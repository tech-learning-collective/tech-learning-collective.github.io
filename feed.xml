The technology was not in itself a completely new idea. After all, similar technologies like the well-known File Transfer Protocol (FTP) had been designed and deployed for copying files between computers before. What made this one so potent was the way it reflected the fractured, organic structure of its underlying medium, the Internet itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of treating each file as a single monolithic whole, this new technology broke each file apart into a set of similarly-sized pieces and treated each piece independently of any other piece. Unlike earlier client-server technologies like FTP, this new “peer-to-peer” technology could retrieve any piece of the whole from any other peer who already had a copy of that piece, even if that peer didn’t have all the pieces like a traditional server would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new technology was called &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/File-Sharing-for-Fun-and-Profit-How-BitTorrent-Works-and-What-You-Can-Do-With-It&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;, and its segmented-file transfer technology is, to this day, the bane of corporate gatekeepers like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). BitTorrent succeeded because it mirrored the decentralized nature of the network on which it was deployed, the Internet. BitTorrent and the Internet are both technologies that do not require any special permission or product to connect to, interoperate with, or extend. If you have a computer running an operating system with a TCP/IP software stack installed, like any modern Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux distribution, &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Clearing-Away-the-Clouds-How-Computer-Networks,-Servers,-and-the-Internet-Work&quot;&gt;you can extend the Internet&lt;/a&gt;. All you have to do is connect your computer to another computer already pre-attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we still learn from BitTorrent’s success twenty years later? If we want to accept &lt;a href=&quot;https://c4ss.org/content/53608&quot;&gt;the “Internet’s offer” of freedom&lt;/a&gt;, as envisioned by optimistic earlier generations, we must (re)learn this vital lesson: the Internet is tangential. We merely need to create &lt;em&gt;an internet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet (capital-I) is the name of a specific network. The Internet “hosts” computers with names like Google, Facebook, and the Wall Street Journal. In contrast, the word internet (lowercase-i) describes any network of interconnected networks. An internet can host everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction is absolutely critical. To connect your computer to the Internet, you are required to pony up fiat currency to a company like Comcast, Verizon, or Rogers. There are, however, many internets that you can connect to for free, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://guifi.net/&quot;&gt;Guifi&lt;/a&gt; in Spain or &lt;a href=&quot;https://nycmesh.net/&quot;&gt;NYCMesh&lt;/a&gt; here in New York City. Unlike the Internet, you can even create a new internet on your own, optionally connecting it to any other internet willing and able to connect back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Internet was The Internet, it was simply an internet. To win the Internet back from the forces of industrialization suffocating the promise of freedom online, we must focus first on building new internets: we must break the Internet and our understanding of it into pieces, just like BitTorrent segmented files, so that we can collaboratively reconstruct it anew, and in the process threaten the literal marketshare and metaphorical mindshare that these monopolies currently have over us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, you might think this is a lot of work, but in reality much of the work has already been done. The resources required in terms of money and equipment are minimal and becoming ever more ubiquitous. There is also no need to write new code or build new apps to make this happen. We already have all the raw materials we need to get the job done. The only thing we lack is broader commitment from neighborhood residents and community members themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it take to build an internet? We’ll need computers, of course, but not especially powerful or expensive ones. As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/choosing-a-homebrew-server.html#benefits-and-disadvantages-of-laptops-as-servers&quot;&gt;Homebrew Server Club explains&lt;/a&gt;, personal “[l]aptops make good homebrew servers since they are widely available, relatively powerful and energy efficient.” Wire up two laptops together using a commonplace Ethernet (RJ-45) cable and you have the beginnings of an internet. Add a third laptop, or perhaps a &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;, and you can run a dedicated service such as a Web site or shared address book or calendar. You can even create a Wi-Fi connection for roaming clients (perhaps your new tiny internet is in an infoshop), all without ever connecting to The Internet proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll need imagination. Your internet may be small right now, but it can grow, just like the original internet grew to become The Internet we know today. Perhaps you publish a Web site of resistance poetry as part of a collection of ebooks (you are at an infoshop after all) and your woke neighbors want to browse the collection, too. Get another Ethernet cable and plug them in, no credit card required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internets like this already exist. We mentioned Guifi in Spain and NYC Mesh in New York City, but there are also smaller pockets of neighborhood-scale internets that offer local services in exactly this fashion. Some even connect back to the Internet proper (like NYCMesh does), so that they can simultaneously offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://nycmesh-docs.netlify.app/intra-mesh-services/&quot;&gt;local-only services&lt;/a&gt; as well as more traditional Internet access. One way to think about these interconnected pockets of computers is the same way as you would think about the multiple computers connected to the Wi-Fi network in your house: you only pay for one connection, but you can connect many hundreds if not more computers to that one connection at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internetworking technologies, like BitTorrent, are built on the notion of smaller pieces, each of them individually-addressable segments, that can be composed together to create a larger whole. Neither the Internet nor BitTorrent file transfers are actually monoliths. That means we do not need any person’s or any company’s permission, license key, or commercial product to create our own, to interconnect them to our peers, and to run and maintain useful services on them. It’s long past time for us to stop asking or paying for permission to build the world we want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you live far away from the rad infoshop in our example, above? It turns out that creating new internets is not an either-or proposition, nor a zero-sum game. Internets that are physically distant from one another can still securely piggy-back on an existing capital-I Internet connection to knit themselves together by using Virtual Private Network (VPN) and/or Tor (Onion service) networking technologies. Again, this is exactly how physically disjointed pieces of community-owned and cooperatively-run networks like those we’ve mentioned earlier are re-connected. Join enough individually operated internets together—that is, run another Ethernet cable to the next building, and the next, and the next—and we’ll have a newly minted “Internet” to rival the current one. Except, this time, we’ll own it outright instead of renting access to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of data over telecom links is much like the flow of electricity over a wire or water through a pipe, not just in its technical mechanics, but in its human dependencies, too. The electric grid could not exist without electricians. Running water in your apartment would not be possible without competent plumbers. System administrators and network engineers, not programmers, code bootcamps, or Big Tech diversity initiatives, are needed to create and then to maintain independent internets like we’ve described here. Moreover, it is these more infrastructural components of telecom autonomy that are the first prerequisite steps we must take to win back the Internet from its corporate and governmental masters. Put another way, there are too many programmers and not enough system administrators precisely because &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html&quot;&gt;more programmers are what corporations need in capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, but more system administrators are what revolutionary communities need for a just and equitable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why radical tech education efforts such as those by &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective&lt;/a&gt; focus on infrastructure over code, where students are taught fundamental internetworking skills overlooked by the rush-to-employment programs of various school-to-corporation pipelines. It’s why projects like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shiftctrlspace/library&quot;&gt;Shift-CTRL Space Library&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a pre-packaged collection of software to more easily share collections of e-books (PDFs, zines, and more), are built using widely available Free Software and without consideration for available capital-I Internet access as it’s traditionally envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have the power, the materials, and the motive to &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/10/08/the-internet-was-always-anarchist-so-anarchists-must-learn-to-become-responsible-for-operating-it.html&quot;&gt;fight and win back the Internet&lt;/a&gt;. But we can’t start at the last step of building (even more) “new” apps. We have to start with the first step first: owning our own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">In April 2001, five months before 9/11, Bram Cohen began designing a new file sharing protocol that would almost single-handedly change the face of the music, TV, and movie industries for the next two decades.

To act anarchically simply means to act independently of a master. It does not mean acting in an uncoordinated or unorganized fashion, nor does it always mean a total absence of layered responsibilities, more commonly known as “hierarchy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is anarchist because the above describes not only the actual operation of basic Internet network protocols such as Ethernet and TCP/IP, but also its designers’ original intentions. When Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet in the 1970’s, he intentionally designed his system in a way that would function anarchically. Unlike competing technologies of the day such as Token Ring, in which individual participants deferred to one another based on which one held all the power to speak at that time (the network’s “token” holder), Metcalfe’s Ethernet instead purposefully permitted any participating device to say anything on the network at any time it wanted. Collisions and conflicts were handled independently, by the individual devices creating the conflict through a simple set of rules (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection, or CSMA/CD), a process unmediated by external controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many engineers believed this approach was too chaotic to succeed. How could a system of coordination function with no command center? It would be pure anarchy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, every Internet connection, local network, telephone uplink, datacenter backhaul, and Wi-Fi signal to your computer uses Ethernet. The anarchist approach proved simpler, more efficient, and ultimately more successful. This is no surprise to any practicing anarchist, although many practicing anarchists still won’t recognize the anarchism in action when they post their next Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people, including and arguably especially most digital technologists, can intuitively understand the principles of anarchic coordination. There are myriad examples of modern technologies with names such as consensus algorithms, cluster orchestration, and distributed ledgers (like “blockchains”) that are, when you actually stop to examine them, fundamentally anarchic approaches to solving complex problems in environments with various degrees of trust between participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale cluster orchestration tools like Kubernetes, a Google invention, function primarily thanks to a coordinating set of components each with very specific horizontally organized responsibilities that act autonomously of one another, merely responding to changes in their environment as they occur. The Internet’s own Certificate Transparency Log (CTL), which audits the issuance of website security certificates such as those offered for free to website owners by Let’s Encrypt, is a massively distributed consensus database run by many independent organizations that uses the same underlying technology as Bitcoin. The backbones of the Internet itself, like the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), are each delegatable systems in which anyone, at any time, can participate simply by connecting a computer with free and open source software to the Internet and claiming responsibility over a new autonomous region, called a “domain” in DNS’s lingo or an “autonomous system number” (ASN) in the language of BGP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the newly initiated, this all seems remarkably fragile. And yet, somehow, the Internet has proven surprisingly resilient. But most technologists aren’t able to see the parallels between their beloved technology and the anarchist viewpoint largely because they simply do not spend much of their time thinking about social organization or politics. At least, not beyond the next four-year election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must change. And we’re going to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? Such a change will not happen through the proliferation of code bootcamps or “learn to code” initiatives. It will not happen through diversity campaigns sponsored by and centered within the tech industry. Technologists, like most people in a comfortable and financially privileged societal position and class stratification, are not generally willing to examine their biases or change their worldview. It is both unreasonable of us and strategically foolhardy of us to ask them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the cost of radicalizing technologists is enormous. Changing an individual’s worldview is a very heavy lift. As a strategy writ large, it is a failing one. The “battle over hearts and minds” is not a battle worth fighting, at least not directly, because what changes hearts and minds is not reason, but experience. Not reciting facts about the present, but taking actions that inspire imagination about the future. Not engaging in debates, but actually making concrete changes in someone’s material circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the cost of training radicals in modern information technology, on the other hand, is negligible. It is of course also difficult, but it is nowhere near as difficult to learn a new set of skills as it is to learn an entirely new and paradigmatically different worldview. As a strategy writ large, “technicalizing radicals” is one with boundless potential, while “radicalizing techies” has proven to be a disastrous waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s activist landscape looks very different from the days of Civil Rights marches, the Anti-War Movement, or even the Anti-Globalization Movement prior to 9/11. If we are to traverse this different terrain, we require a different kind of vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a particularly new idea. Some will remember the Crypto Wars in the 1980’s and 1990’s, in which governments reserved encryption technology solely for military use. Cypherpunk and early “Hacker” culture sprang from this era. But neither cypherpunk nor “Hacker” communities were particularly anarchist, in either ideology nor practice. Instead, they largely imported and mirrored mainstream ideas such as gender, economic, and racial stereotypes, spending most of their time naively imagining themselves in a far-flung utopia in which the mere existence of technologies relying on anarchic methods would inevitably lead to a reformation of society with equality and justice for all even as reality turned increasingly towards nightmarish dystopias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By and large, technically skilled hackers wrapped themselves in the glow of their terminals the way politicians wrap themselves up in their country’s flags. They mostly ignored the forces of industrialization re-centralizing the Internet and turning it into massive digital strip malls like Facebook. By the time they awoke from their Matte-fueled reveries several decades later, their world had been colonized and their comrades would be targeted as criminals under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act enacted a decade or more earlier. Famous exceptions such as Pirate Bay founder Peter Sunde notwithstanding, the earlier generation of hackers fumbled because they failed to recognize and center the importance of the anarchist principles underlying the very technologies they wrongly treated as inherently liberating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they had brought a more explicitly anarchist lens with them, they would have recognized that neither anarchy nor liberation are states that can be described by their state machines, but rather they are constant processes in which individuals must repeatedly take action to reaffirm their resistance against the formation of an Archos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today that means politically conscious Anarchists must take responsibility for the operation and administration of interconnected networks of communication, if not also the capital-I Internet itself, in order to ensure that fascism is constantly beaten back. This goes beyond merely “no-platforming” fascists and coding the next much-hyped Web app, social network platform, or encrypted messenger. That’s not enough. Not by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, anarchists must make ourselves capable of physically running networking cable from one neighborhood into another. We must learn to administer critical internet functions like the Domain Name System ourselves, independently from commercial providers. We must work to scale out, rather than scale up, massive datacenter operations and place them physically in the communities that rely on them instead of halfway around the globe, for exactly the same reason we must abolish police departments whose patrols are often conducted by personnel who don’t live in the neighborhood they are responsible for policing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of work, but not as much as one may at first think. Best of all, the resources it actually requires in terms of money and equipment are minimal and becoming ever more ubiquitous. There is also no need to write new code or build new apps to make this happen. We already have all the raw materials we need to get the job done. The only thing we lack is broader commitment from anarchists, themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In New York City, several Anarchist and anarcho-autonomist collectives have been slowly converging to provide technological and digital infrastructure support services to anti-fascist, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist organizations in a repeatable, reproducible way. These services range from computer training for activists and advocacy groups to direct assistance with digital components of advocacy efforts, and even private audits of an ally’s security posture when requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some groups, like Anarcho-Tech NYC, are entirely volunteer-run organizations operating without any licensing or legal recognition and a financial budget intentionally as close to zero as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others, like Tech Learning Collective, provide frequent free, by-donation, and low-cost technical training to otherwise underserved communities and organizations advancing social justice causes in an effort to help fund projects for radical social good while simultaneously “upskilling” politically motivated and technologically-curious students. An apprenticeship-based and security-first technology school founded and operated exclusively by radical queer and femme technologists, Tech Learning Collective hosts virtual (remote/online) computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with technology-centered community groups like Shift-CTRL Space who connect local, grassroots organizers with free resources on technology, this growing “digital rainbow coalition” focusing on a range of IT and telecoms infrastructure and education initiatives is demonstrating how to have an outsized impact on anti-fascist organizing in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As anarchists, we like to say that another world is possible. The truth is, another world has been here all along. It’s in the palm of our hand every time we read a text from our friends. All we have to do is learn how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">When Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet in the 1970's, he intentionally designed his system in a way that would function anarchically.

If you choose to subscribe, you’ll receive inspiring projects and tutorials from diverse creators, upcoming events from around the world, and information about open calls and other opportunities for beginners through experts. We’re grateful to Martha for continuing to support Tech Learning Collective by sharing our events and, this time, for featuring our work in this new feature issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first met some of the Tech Learning Collective team what now feels like a million years ago, in my former life in the, um, murky world of startups. I was immediately impressed by what felt like a strong and specific agenda to their work, a pleasant and welcome surprise during a time when I was mostly feeling sad and overwhelmed by the culture and cults of Silicon Valley. Amidst weeks of vapid conversations about “disruption” and “agility,” I had an immediate sense of, oh, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; team is really committed and doing something pointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve since been able to check out some TLC workshops in person and online, as well as some other events they’ve hosted. They tap into a particularly urgent niche: accessible, affordable, welcoming instruction around critical topics of cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, TLC is offering some workshops particularly centered around Tor and the Dark Web, and I had the opportunity to reach out to the team with some questions about their curriculum. Check out some of their &lt;a href=&quot;/events/upcoming/&quot;&gt;upcoming sessions&lt;/a&gt;, and stick around for some exclusive content re: their mission and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a meaty interview, but it’s worth the read! I was gonna condense it initially but, in the spirit of my personal fav rant of late in favor of longer, more thoughtful reading, I’m including all of TLC’s extremely thorough and thoughtful answers to my questions. Block a lil time to read and digest this one! If you care about technology education, it’s important to interrogate our educators, and understand their goals. Chopping up their answers into soundbites wouldn’t feel in service to that spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What makes Tech Learning Collective different from bootcamps and other organizations that teach subjects like computer literacy or digital security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for asking this question, because it’s both the most important and most difficult for a lot of people to internalize. There are a lot of differences across many metrics ranging from pedagogy and curriculum to personnel and outcomes but, in a word, the core difference is our mission. To really understand what we mean by this, you have to understand that, by and large, there are two categories of “tech education” organizations out there each with their own mission that we’d like to distinguish ourselves from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group are the ones you’ve identified: bootcamps, which are basically just Internet-era versions of for-profit trade schools, and more traditional schooling institutions (colleges, night schools, freelance trainers on YouTube, and so on). Put bluntly, the goal for these institutions is to help you get a job. They are trying to help you “use technology” in order to “get ahead in life.” There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/03/return-the-magic-to-computers-radio-statler-hope-2020-interview-with-tech-learning-collective.html&quot;&gt;we think that’s a rather unambitious goal and a massively missed opportunity&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also trying to shoehorn a traditional educational approach—teaching to a test, getting certifications, reading books—to a topic that really requires a far more interactive and immersive experience to gain any meaningful skill in. &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html&quot;&gt;Learning how to get good with computers is more like learning a language than memorizing a bunch of facts about binary arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;. We think the approach most schools take doesn’t sufficiently acknowledge this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group we’d like to distinguish ourselves from are the more policy-focused “community” or “advocacy” groups that have sprung up around the world in the wake of political revelations such as the Snowden documents. The goal for these communities is primarily awareness-raising. They tend to be good at introducing people to the political relevance of the topic, but routinely fall short of providing education in a way that is all of accessible, actionable, and thorough. Most of these groups have their heart in the right place, but don’t have the expertise or the structure necessary to do a sufficient job training students who want to see more than the tip of the iceberg because they are organized in an extremely ad-hoc way that responds to the news cycle and focuses on non-technical things such as legal petitions, fundraising campaigns, or social initiatives. While certainly helpful, we don’t think any of those actions can be performed sufficiently well to make a meaningful difference without first truly understanding the fundamentals of the problem domain, which these groups often lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s mission is neither job acquisition nor awareness-raising. Rather, our mission is revolutionary, even insurrectionary political change. Practically, this means we teach things that other schools don’t, and you can see this reflected in our curriculum, in which even the “beginner” courses cover topics with a heavy focus on system reliability engineering (IT infrastructure) and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, most schools will teach you how to build a Web app but don’t teach you much about the environment in which Web apps operate, because they just assume you’re going to rent some space on a Web hosting provider or purchase a compute cluster from Amazon AWS. At Tech Learning Collective, you’ll learn how to make your own Amazon AWS-equivalent infrastructure and run a world-class, multi-node, highly-available datacenter infrastructure yourself, but we won’t show you how to build a custom Web application. This is because the world doesn’t need yet another Web application, to say nothing of how superfluous such a thing is for the global movement for justice. What it needs is more system administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By eschewing employment, our students are also free to focus on the technical underpinnings of communication technologies in ways that will help them understand the modern world at a much deeper level than other educational curriculums. When you are focused on practicing how to pass a test, so that you can get a certification, so that you can get an interview, so that you can get a foot in the door at a company, so that you can make a living wage, you are many miles away from community building, &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/29/democracy-is-bankrupt-id-like-an-extra-large-i-voted-sticker-with-a-side-of-political-sedative-please.html&quot;&gt;prefigurative political change&lt;/a&gt;, or even personal fulfillment in many cases. Besides, numerous Tech Learning Collective students have in fact had more success in getting jobs in the tech industry thanks to this more foundational approach than they had at prior bootcamp-style institutions precisely because of the deeper understanding they gained with us; many &lt;a href=&quot;/testimonials/&quot;&gt;students routinely tell us&lt;/a&gt; they learned more in one of our two-hour workshops than in full semesters at college on the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that jobs are important for survival in the current society, but the fact of the matter is that many companies now automatically disqualify most bootcamp graduates out of the hiring process because of how technical training schools—including the expensive, name-brand ones—routinely fail to prepare students for a real-life work environment. (See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools&quot;&gt;Sarah McBride’s feature article on the topic in Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.) In contrast, at Tech Learning Collective, students gain experience exclusively with Free and Open Source software in ways that are immediately valuable to them regardless of whether they end up using that skill in their personal life, at a future office job, or as part of an advocacy project outside the realm of techno-capitalism. This versatility, coupled with the fact that Tech Learning Collective courses and workshops are, on average, approximately ten thousand dollars less expensive than most technical trade schools, makes Tech Learning Collective a dramatically different experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other distinction to draw is that because we are not trying to convince students of the importance of certain political issues the way many community education projects are, we can spend more time focusing on how the technology actually works. To be blunt, this means students actually get a meaningful technical education in addition to the ambient political education they would get at a one-off community event, for example. Most of our students who return to take multiple workshops are actually people who have been to one or more community advocacy groups, but quickly found those groups unable to provide deeper technical instruction when they began asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone wants to take that next step beyond simply being aware of an issue, and that’s okay, too. But Tech Learning Collective was designed from the ground-up to be a place where people with political motivations can learn the kinds of skills they’ll need to confront adversaries to their political dreams, whether those adversaries are government agencies like the NSA, CIA, FBI, or corporate security teams, professional hackers (penetration testers), political opposition groups, or simply cybercriminals looking to do harm to their organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you build a school with that goal in mind, what you end up with is an extremely serious divergence from the kinds of places that cooperate with the existing paradigm, either by encouraging employment, or by re-enacting the same awareness-raising campaigns that have more or less failed to make meaningful policy changes for far too long. Once you understand that our goals are not the same as many of these other groups, our other differences, such as our 100% Socratic pedagogy (e.g., there are no slideshows or PowerPoints in any of our workshops, ever) or choice of software platforms (we never use closed-source or proprietary commercial products, including in our “cloud” workshops) start to make a lot more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other differences, of course: &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/09/queer-all-the-electronic-things-our-love-for-the-command-line.html&quot;&gt;we take great care to make our workshops welcoming to political radicals, trans people, femmes, and BIPOC folk&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, we work to be actively hostile to Trump supporters and white supremacists, for example. (Many of our in-class exercises feature political messaging as a kind of background music.) But these choices all stem from our core mission, which is to empower you and your political affinity groups with the kind of powerful capabilities that go far beyond mere electoral representation. We want you to have the kind of power usually reserved for multi-national corporations, and never before has such asymmetrical power been within reach for small groups of competent, well-trained, committed, politically motivated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not squander the opportunity to do something grand with that possibility. You can read more about what makes Tech Learning Collective so different on &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;our Web site’s About page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Privacy and digital security seem like such critical topics right now, given the political climate, but also seem to be pretty misunderstood. Why is it important to TLC to be sharing these particular skills right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe and secure communication is a prerequisite to political change. If you can’t coordinate actions, brainstorm strategies, or receive feedback without those who would oppose you listening in, then you can’t realize your goals. Without the ability to communicate securely, you can’t make use of any power you might otherwise have. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably helpful to know that Tech Learning Collective instructors have been practicing digital security for literally decades. A lot of people first heard about the kinds of mass surveillance and other illegal behavior on the part of law enforcement like parallel construction when the Snowden leaks made the news in 2013. However, it’s important to remember that there was a verifiable parade of whistleblowers who sounded the alarm about the same things Snowden did well before Snowden was even out of High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers like Thomas Drake, William Binney, John Kiriakou, and many more came many years before Snowden. A lot of what Snowden had to say simply added detail to information that those of us who have been in these trenches already had even before 9/11. Unfortunately, the public didn’t really understand the importance of what these early whistleblowers were saying. Large swaths of the public probably still don’t really get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, sure, for a lot of people, these are critical topics “right now,” but for those of us involved in Tech Learning Collective, these have been critical topics for well over twenty years. The core members of Tech Learning Collective have also been involved in anti-surveillance organizing and cybersecurity education for decades. From our perspective, these topics are more well-understood than they ever have been before. It’s equally important to be sharing these particular skills now as it was back in 1993, when the same basic technology to, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Securing-Email-Protecting-Everyday-Communications-from-GMail-to-ProtonMail&quot;&gt;encrypt emails&lt;/a&gt; that we use today (modestly called “&lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/OpenPGP-How-to-Protect-Everything-with-Pretty-Good-Privacy&quot;&gt;Pretty Good Privacy&lt;/a&gt;”) was first made available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t feel disheartened if you’re just coming around to this now, though. Better late than never!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Something I’ve been experiencing is that I have been having more and more conversations with friends and peers who feel frustrated with or concerned by big tech companies like Google or Facebook, or with government use of technology, but don’t seem ready to take the leap into using tools like Tor. What would you say to someone who thinks that Tor isn’t for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’d rather spend our time talking to folks who are willing to learn something new than those who are unwilling or unable to consider doing that. So, if you’re asking for our advice, we would tell you simply to let your friends be. We suspect you are more likely to change their behavior by changing your own than by debating the merits of your choices with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, when someone tells us they don’t understand why we use privacy-enhancing technologies like Tor, we tell them we do so for the same reason we won’t give them all our passwords. The disconnect for them usually stems from an under-appreciation of how impactful a privacy violation really is. This is why, in our cybersecurity workshops, we focus on teaching offensive (“hacking”) techniques just as often, if not more often, than we focus on defensive techniques. It’s one thing to have a conversation with someone else in the abstract about “not letting anyone see your browsing history.” It’s quite another to show them how a hacker or a government agency can view their personal browsing habits simply by &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams&quot;&gt;performing a Machine-in-the-Middle or browser hooking attack&lt;/a&gt; against them, personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot more luck showing people why they might want to use Tor after we show them how we can snoop on Internet traffic. For that reason alone, we think it’s useful to learn about network packet sniffing, for example. We have &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning&quot;&gt;a whole workshop dedicated to these topics&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One silver lining of the pandemic I’ve experienced is that I’ve been able to take online classes with organizations who previously primarily offered in-person workshops. Has the shift to online offerings impacted your curriculum or mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to online offerings hasn’t changed our mission or our curriculum a lot, but it has absolutely changed our own infrastructure. We used to focus on in-person classes, but &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/03/15/one-way-we-re-doing-what-we-can-to-support-our-community-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;between February and April 2020 we transformed ourselves into an entirely virtual (online) school&lt;/a&gt;. Every workshop now happens online in one of a variety of video conferencing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also prompted us to create some new workshops. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/File-Sharing-for-Fun-and-Profit-How-BitTorrent-Works-and-What-You-Can-Do-With-It&quot;&gt;our workshop about how BitTorrent works (and how to share files with it)&lt;/a&gt; was spurred by the introduction of lockdown and the observation that many people were watching a lot more streaming media. Similarly, the recent absurdity over the potential ban against TikTok has spurred &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Two-Places-at-Once-Understanding-Virtual-Private-Networks&quot;&gt;our workshop on VPNs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, for us, the shift to “online-everything” has been a huge boon, because the logistics of organizing a digital classroom instead of a physical one is far easier to automate. Last year, we hosted on average three or four workshops a month. This year, we routinely host upwards of fifteen workshops each month because what once took hours of preparation and lots of emails to coordinate with classroom venues now takes literally seconds and we can do it entirely on our own. So in that sense, we were actually happy that people became more willing to give online classes a shot. We just wish the circumstances had not been so painful and tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we want to point out that this dramatic increase in our capacity and its simultaneous reduction in menial labor (going from three to fifteen workshops a month is, like, a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; difference!) is the kind of thing that computers are supposed to do for all of us. It’s almost criminal that most people experience the expansion of digital technology into their lives as a stressor rather than a blessing. We were able to take advantage of the move to online learning because we are already automation experts familiar with the digital systems mediating the majority of everything from financial to social interaction in society writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal at Tech Learning Collective workshops and classes is to make that possible for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">This week's issue of Martha Hipley's &quot;An Artist's Guide to Computation&quot; features an interview with Tech Learning Collective.

As the nation gears up for what is arguably one of the most highly contentious General Election seasons in a long time, permit us a few moments to share some timely thoughts with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to vote (to help soundly oust Trump from the Presidency), but we want you to do it while recognizing the reality that voting is &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; the least you can do in pursuit of that goal. To vote while incorrectly believing that your vote is more meaningful than basically anything else you can do to establish material power in your life and community is to mentally ingest a toxic political sedative that poisons your participation in society and degrades your material power. Recognize that the “I Voted!” sticker you’re bound to see on people’s backpacks and phones this November is usually not a badge of genuine political engagement, but rather a tranquilizer patch doling out time-release political anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, vote all you want. (Really!) But don’t naively assume your vote will meaningfully change how, why, or when the Amerikkkan government will still spy on us, its jar-headed, jack-booted government-funded white supremacists who traded their white cloaks for their camo fatigues or their badges will still terrorize us, and its social services will still turn us away due to lack of funding, lack of competency, lack of empathy, or all three. Red or Blue might as well be Coke or Pepsi, with maybe a touch of cyanide in one or the other depending on which Facebook filter bubble the Zuck has decided your timeline should show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the facts: you have one chance to vote for your representative as President every four years, but you have at least 365 chances to increase your material power in this world each and every year. Seen in that light, elections matter a lot less than they’re made out to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people wrongly think voting is the most profound political act they can take because it somehow directly determines their future, when in reality all it amounts to is at best a false choice between one poison pill or another. Freedom doesn’t come from a ballot box. On the ballots most people talk about, no candidate gives a shit about you. Why should they? The entire apparatus of Nation State government is designed to reward people who don’t give a flying fuck whether what they do with the power of their office is legal, ethical, or even sensible. Importantly, that fact isn’t a Trump phenomenon, either. Powerful people in government have been brazenly boasting about this since at least 1975, when contemporary Mr. Realpolitik himself, Henry Kissinger, is quoted in one conversation saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to say at meetings, ‘The illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer.’ [laughter]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/11/wikileaks-kissinger-cables-bradley-manning&quot;&gt;The US diplomatic cables provided to the world by Chelsea Manning&lt;/a&gt;. Look it up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So people vote, but little if anything improves in their lives as a result. Then, by the millions, frustratingly, they just wait. For &lt;em&gt;four years&lt;/em&gt;. Even most of the “activists” who aren’t just sitting around twiddling their thumbs start doing…what, exactly? Oh yeah, their much-lauded, highly publicized, celebrity-backed Get Out The Vote campaigns. This is not the behavior of a body politic actively engaged in their own governance. This is a body politic addicted to societal-scale political sedatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to change your political reality, you need to start by becoming more powerful than you currently are. What do you have that is actually real, meaningful, political power? Do you have money? Do you have connections to or influence over a lot of other people? Do you have remarkable individual skill that you actually use in your personal or communal spheres to improve your life and the lives of the people you care about? If you don’t have those things and, let’s face it, most voters don’t, then you don’t have any actual power. And without any power, hard as it is to hear, everything you do—even and arguably especially your vote—doesn’t make a dent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, with all that said, we still think it’s important to remind you to vote early and by mail this year if you can. Why? Because voting is &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; the least you can do. We want you to vote, but we want you to recognize that voting matters &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;, not more, than literally &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; other act you take every day of your life. Voting matters less, not more, than whether you’re chatting with your friends on Facebook Messenger or &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State&quot;&gt;Signal Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. Voting matters less, not more, than whether you spend your $5 at Starbuck’s or at the BIPOC-owned local coffeehouse two blocks further away from the bus station. Voting matters less, not more, than whether you read your Twitter feed or a book from the library when you get home tonight. Voting matters less, not more, than who you choose to smile at on the street, to talk with, to get to know, to spend your time around. Voting matters less, not more, than spending a moment alone, eyes closed, phone switched off, listening to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voting is not how you express your politics. Voting is, at most, one tiny and relatively insignificant artifact that &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; from your true political expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Tech Learning Collective, our goal is to make it easier for you to do the far more meaningful political work of building real, material, concrete power in your own life through mastery over digital tools and information systems. Creating an autonomous infrastructure that can obsolete this whole rotten system from its root is obviously more impactful, and thus arguably more important, than voting. But so is just asking the question, “Wait, how does this &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way: Fuck Trump? Well, duh. But fuck having Presidents? Now you’re speaking our language. Your vote can be—and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be—ignored. Your resistance can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">As the United States gears up for what is arguably one of the most highly contentious General Election seasons in a long time, we wanted to share our thoughts about the importance&amp;mdash;and limitations&amp;mdash;of voting, and how our political credo in this arena shapes our curriculum and our priorities. Our goal, as always, is to make it easier for you to succeed at truly impactful political work through mastery of digital and information systems.

It’s a huge, well-renowned event that regularly brings international superstars like Edward Snowden to their stage. This year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the conference was moved entirely online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the wholly-virtual conference format was a disappointment for many regulars, it was a very welcome change for us at Tech Learning Collective. It was specifically because of the decision to move the conference online that Tech Learning Collective members felt comfortable enough to submit workshop proposals for consideration. Had the conference been held in person, we would have chosen not to participate because of the fact that mainstream “hacker community” spaces are not spaces where we feel particularly comfortable or safe. Offering an alternative to those more mainstream spaces is, after all, one of the main reasons Tech Learning Collective exists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were happy to have all of our proposals accepted by the HOPE 2020 workshops selection committee and are grateful for the opportunity they gave us to showcase our different cultural, pedagogical, and philosophical approaches to classic hacking topics such as &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams&quot;&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers&quot;&gt;hash cracking&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/World-Wide-Wars-Introduction-to-Exploiting-Web-Applications&quot;&gt;Web exploitation&lt;/a&gt;. And while we hope the three two-hour workshops we facilitated for HOPE 2020 ticketholders were educational or at least fun for everyone who showed up, our own deeper hope is that people who are looking for something liberatory and ambitious, beyond but overlapping with the famous hacker ethos exemplified by the HOPE 2020 conference and community, found us through our workshops at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, when we were further invited to be interviewed by Erin and Mel of the Nerdy Duo for HOPE 2020’s Internet radio broadcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://radio.hope.net/&quot;&gt;Radio Statler&lt;/a&gt;, we accepted quickly. What follows is our (somewhat rushed) transcript of the far-reaching interview, along with an audio recording, of our hour-plus segment on Radio Statler during HOPE 2020 in which we discuss the mission and vision of Tech Learning Collective, our philosophical approach to computer technology, hacking, anarcho-autonomism, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TLC interviewee: Thanks so much for having us on. Which one of you is Beaches? Do you mind my asking that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel (interviewer 1): Beaches isn’t here right now. Beaches has to work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Oh, well, Beaches has been very helpful in helping us organize logistics for this. So just shout-out to whoever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin (interviewer 2): Oh, he’s the greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Beaches is the greatest. I’m very fond of Beaches. So I think my first question for you guys is, Oh, my gosh, how have I not spent a million hours with you?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC Interviewee: Um, that’s, uh, probably because for a long time, we were only doing in person things in New York City. So if you were not in New York City, you were probably not as aware of us. We began in, well, a little actually before 2016. But we sort of officially became more open to the public or inviting folks who we didn’t already have some sort of preconceived connection with to workshops and things that we were holding in person classes, at around 2016-ish, just after the Trump election for some obvious reasons. And, so, the result is that for the past, only for the past about eight months or so have we really been sort of pushing a lot of online things. And that of course, is a result of a pandemic. So it’s possible that you didn’t know about it simply because maybe I don’t know if you’re in New York City or not, but if you aren’t, that would be a good reason why not, and also—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Up the river. We’re up the river, across the river from Sing-Sing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: I see. Yeah, so we never quite ventured that far North personally, obviously, New York City is a huge, huge town and it has a ton of spaces. And so we’ve basically been very inner city focused for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Um, I’m so excited to like meet you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Tell us about you your mission…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: …what you’re up to lately.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Sure. So, um, I mean, the sales pitch, if you will, is simply that we take a security-first approach to all this tech education that we think is vital for, bluntly, any kind of revolutionary or insurrectionary politic. We have a very different approach than a lot of other schools primarily because we don’t focus on things like jobs, we don’t focus on things like interviews or coding skill, particularly. There’s a huge as you know, of course, you know, boot camp style initiative happening ever since, you know, the mid, early, really 2010s. And there’s just been this focus on, like, learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And that for a while, this is a—I don’t know how much of this history you’re actually interested in, so I’m sort of all over the place. But, this really started from the notion that Tech Learning Collective began as a mutual self education group.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So back in 2015 and early 2016 it wasn’t for the public. It was for us, it was for people who felt alienated from code boot camps, felt alienated from the tech scene, who didn’t really have an interest in technology for the perspective of getting jobs or changing a career or this kind of thing. And so what that meant was that a huge amount of education that was focused around that approach just wasn’t really relevant. Like we didn’t really care about the things that were being taught not because those things aren’t important or useful, or in some way, for example, can be used in in non-job contexts, but because the instruction around it was entirely too narrow-mindedly focused on here’s how you get a job, here’s how we’re going to help you get a job, here’s how you’re going to then make money in this career. Here’s the best way is to, for example, get your certifications and your licenses and all this sort of stuff, right. And so we didn’t we didn’t care about that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We cared about helping our communities and our friends, put up websites about their activist efforts, we cared about getting food distribution networks set up we cared about helping people like Food Not Bombs or CopWatch and this sort of stuff. And those skills, while overlapping, take a very different approach, or you need a very different approach to sort of take someone who hasn’t had any background in technology, and make it possible for them to do things like those community efforts with technology, than one in which you’re constantly telling them to like work for Amazon, you know, or get a job at Google, or learn how to do, you know, sort of huge global scale infrastructures. Like, that isn’t relevant to a neighborhood of 100,000 people even, right, you don’t need, if you don’t have a million active users, you know, per hour, you don’t need half the things that you’re being taught in these sort of, you know, schools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The other part is that we don’t have the money! A lot of that software’s proprietary, if you’re going to network engineering, you’re probably going to get a Cisco iOS certification of some form or another right, CCNP, or something like this, and that’s going to cost you some money, you’re going to need to get the software for that, you’re gonna need the licenses for that, you’re going to need the hardware for that. And, but you don’t need for example, a Cisco iOS device if you’re setting up a mesh network amongst a five block radius, right? OSPF and BGP are not licensed software, right? You can use a VyOS router, you can use this open source stuff that exists, you can use a pfSense box for your edge. And all this stuff you don’t need that kind of material for. So the other aspect of it was just financial cost and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And finally, of course, the other big thing is that there’s a cultural sort of obstacle. And I don’t just mean about the job thing in this sense. I mean, the sorts of people who we are trying to teach don’t tend to get along very well with the sorts of people who are sort of like, you know, engineering managers at big companies. I just mean interpersonally, like we have different philosophies, we have different politics, we have different gender expressions, all sorts of all sorts of issues, race, of course, right. And so there was really a lot of challenges in order to get—like, it’s harder to get—I think this is something that I’ve heard several times in this conference now, some of the speakers have said it’s harder to get technical people without a political awareness to sort of change their political awareness. But it’s relatively easy to train politically aware individuals in technical skill. It’s not easy, but it’s easier, maybe even changing a worldview, right? You don’t have to, for example, change a worldview to understand HTML or to understand JavaScript or to learn to code or to, you know, figure out how to sort of example, do key rotation on SSH servers or set up SSH certificates as opposed to host keys, like none of that, right, that doesn’t require a worldview change. For that you—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: The tools are kind of agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Say that again? Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: The tools are kind of agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: The tools don’t care what philosophy you have, right? They don’t care what political position you have. And so it’s much easier to sort of technical-ize radicals than it is to radicalize techies, if those two things are considered mutually exclusive groups. And they aren’t, of course, I mean, look at us, but they certainly are approached that way in a lot of other educational or activist efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And the other, the last sort of part of this was that while there were many other groups doing a lot of education around this sort of stuff, digital security, anti-surveillance, this sort of stuff. Um, there’s not really a lot of groups that are explicitly trying to create a, we call it a “train the trainer’s” model, where they are, where people are coming to these groups asking about, you know, how do I keep myself safe at protests? How do I not get picked up by cops in a regime, right, or, like, in Portland today? Or, you know, and there are a lot of good, sort of 101[-level] answers to that. There’s a lot of, well, check your phone settings and make sure that you do a factory reset if you think that your devices been compromised, this sort of stuff, but then there’s not a like, then what, how do I then build from that? What do I do next? Where’s my 201? Where’s my like, like, if I want to build some infrastructure, as opposed to just react to things that are happening to me, where do I learn to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so again, the only answer was, well get a job. And that doesn’t work for the kinds of things that we’re trying to do because often what happens when you get a job is that you now spend—like The Onion article right? You follow your dreams in your 30 minutes for lunch. And 30 minutes on your lunch break doesn’t really have enough resources really, in terms of time and attention to actually build an infrastructure for any sort of meaningful movement. So, so there had to be some place to go after you, you know, found yourself in a, for example, anti-surveillance workshop, and then wanted some more information about how this technology worked. And what you could do with it, how to defend against it, how to build something out of the foundational layers, and that ended up becoming Tech Learning Collective, through sort of a series of unfortunate external events and sort of figuring trying to figure out how a group of anti-capitalist Anarchists could sort of coexist with an educational model that required, for example, resources, like space and time. And, the last four years has been sort of the, the work of making that possible. So that’s, that sort of where we come from. I hope that answered your question, in maybe a little bit of a roundabout way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Very thorough.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Very cool. Good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So, you know, for more information about that, obviously, I should point you at TechLearningCollective.com/about, I’m not going to read the website to you, obviously you can, you know, look at the website and read it yourself but that story is repeated there on our about page. And it has some details about, you know, precisely where in 2016 we started and what groups we started working with and this sort of stuff. So there’s more information about that there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As well as workshops and events and classes and our calendar. Now we do almost one workshop every other day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: I think we have upwards of 15 to 16 workshops a month now that are on a scale of either free, by donation, or low cost. And by low cost I mean, there’s a sliding scale for even paid workshops are for as low as $25 for about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: That’s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, and it’s all, you know, it’s kind of—we’re very proud that we have actually stayed active is one thing, but the other thing is that that we are growing at a rate that we didn’t expect to. So now we have workshops that not only range in sort of a sliding scale costs, but also are on topics based everywhere from like, you know, what is a computer? What is the CPU? What are the resources and admin is working with, right? And we really start at the level of, you’re really working with time and space, right, you’ve got a certain amount of space and a certain amount of time to process some information. And that’s really your constraint. So what are the resources in a computer that allow you to do that, right? You have a speed in your computer, that’s time, you have amount of space that you can store something that’s your hard disk, that’s your RAM, etc, right? The network storage, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So that’s where we start, and everything from there all the way through to, for example, working with Docker containers and exploiting web applications. Some of the workshops that we’re doing here obviously are very focused on the offensive security side of things is stuff that we cover. So I think we have over like 35 workshops, individual workshops now and four course tracks that we offer. The workshops and the courses are all based on each other. So it was the case that courses actually were sort of like the main focus of we did, like I mentioned in person classes and sort of the cohort that met with each other, you know, week after week. The pandemic has radically changed how we do this. And now, mostly it’s actually workshops that we’re focusing on. But the material in both the workshops and the courses are the same. So if you for example, signed up for a SYS10 course with us, then basically what you’d be getting is a logistically different presentation of the same topics that we teach and for example, our Taming Daemons workshop, which is one of our one on one courses, our Securing our Servers workshop, which is a deep dive into SSH, this sort of stuff so it’s sort of, they’re parallels of each other, they’re just sort of presented differently at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: We totally understand that big shift. We are—well, first of all, I got totally distracted by oh my gosh, no, I’m not Beaches. I have I have no right to call myself that, Beaches is amazing. And, we are we are artists first and art educators second so the switch from classes to like short bite sized workshops is totally the same shift we’ve had to do. Sometimes we teach overlapping stuff like since we do a lot of digital art like and video and post production stuff we’re tend to be the artists in a space who know anything about tech even though like we’re not always the greatest. I have people I can call for that. Thank goodness!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, you have—it’s important to have people who know how to do a thing if you don’t. This is part of thesocial aspect of learning. It’s part of the infrastructure, right? I mean, other people are an infrastructure as well. And I think part and parcel of what you’re saying is like, there’s you know, there’s, there’s a, it’s when you’re in a classroom, when you’re in a certain kind of educational environment, we think of that educational environment being simply a matter of a collection of materials that you then consume. But that’s not at all how education works, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: No.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: It’s really about an interaction between who’s there and how they’re approaching the material, and you, and how you can plug into that. And so our workshops are like, we get this question a lot like, what how should I prepare for like my SYS101 course? Or how do I prepare for my like, you know, my first Clearing Away the Clouds workshop, something we’re doing later today, not at this conference, but just is happening later today, which is like a NET101 intro. And we always tell people don’t! The point is not to come prepared. The point is to not know when you arrive, and then leave having a clear idea of what to do next. And when you approach things that way, we can take advantage of the time that we have, as in a synchronous workshop, right? Like why pay for stuff that you can read on Wikipedia? That makes no sense as a school.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so when we look at these other sort of educational pedagogies one of the things that didn’t make sense to us was that we didn’t have A) the money and B) the inclination to just, you know, get this specific school’s book that contain the same information as all these other online guides or all these other. You know, I mean, even the RFCs, right, they’re just kind of repeating information in their way. And that’s not bad, you can argue that that’s a value add for some people. But if you’re then spending, for example, two or three hours in a class with somebody, and they’re just showing you that material, then you’re not taking advantage of the fact that you have a human with their own decision making ability, their own ability to sort of, you know, improvise and respond to your questions in person, or I guess over video chat. However you do it. And that’s really going to be where most of the “Aha!” moments can come from, especially if you’re the kind of person who needs some structure in the first place. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So people who are really like, the self taught, “I don’t need to, I don’t need anyone’s help. I want to do this entirely on my own. I don’t want to talk to anyone,” right, those are not our students. And that’s because they don’t need to go to any class to learn this stuff. It might help in terms of a small speed boost to get sort of like a guide, if I’ve never worked with, for example Kubernetes or DevOps material. And I don’t know anything about configuration management, you know, maybe our Faster Than Light workshop, which is all about Ansible, and RBAC using AWX Tower and the Red Hat, sort of open source offerings, is a good thing to go to, because you spend two hours in a class where that’s the topic, instead of spending maybe 18 to 20, reading a book and you get more or less the same material, and you can begin, then, you know, to do things on your own. But the community aspect of the learning is when we see the same students come back in again, and again, and again. These are the ones who tend to want to either learn in a social environment or who want the kind of structure that the black hole of YouTube just doesn’t offer, because the recommendation engine has its own interests and it’s certainly not yours. Right? So, so that that’s a really important part of it. Otherwise, go read a book.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Yeah, that that one-to-one interaction with students is the thing I’ve missed the most all COVID. Yeah, that little lean over the shoulder. And let me just show you this one little trick that’ll speed up what you’re doing. I missed that so much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Just swoop your mouse, just hold this key here. There, you got it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Right. Did you know about this command? Let me show you this particular vim shortcut or like, check out, you know, control-a when you’re in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt;, right, like this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yeah. And that’s sort of the other big difference is that when you give someone for example, a checklist to follow like a lab guide, and that’s sort of all the material that they offer is that sort of interactivity, then you don’t get those opportunities. But if you can create a conversation around the topic that you’re teaching, and so one thing when I teach, for example, is that I tell people, if you’ve never ever done what we’re about to do before, I know there’s going to be a VM that you can follow along with, you know, download and run it and you know, you’ll have the same terminal that I have, but if you’ve never done this before, try to ignore that because you’re going to be seeing the same exact thing that I’m going to be seeing on my screen. So for the time being like for the first time, the first time you’re exposed to this, you’ll probably get more just watching me use the tools in the same way that you could, for example, watch a master craftsman or a craftsperson, right, create a wooden toy, right by watching them work, rather than trying to replicate their movements, sort of by hearing what they tell you to do, and not watching their hands. And so it’s the same exact process. If I, for example, I’m using my terminal in a way that you know, you haven’t seen before. Maybe you never use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt;, or haven’t seen a multiplexed terminal before, that alone is going to be like, “Whoa, what is this?” And you’re not necessarily going to get that by following a lab’s sort of checklist of hit this goal, then this goal, then this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And this is particularly important for security concepts, because security, more than almost any other, is a field in which you don’t want to restrict someone’s thinking to just the steps that are on paper. Right? The security principle of—there’s, I don’t know if it’s a joke or what, but I’ve heard it over and over and over again, which is you as a pentester, right, the thing you want to do is read the requirements docs. And then every time that they, that the requirements docs say, or the RFCs say that something must be the case, check to make sure it is, cuz it’s probably, it might not be! Every time where it or something says “optional,” check both cases, see if it’s on or not, right? And that’s basically just, like, the RFC is your beginning pentest guide. But if you’re trained in school, to think only, “okay, well, if I do this, then I’m good, then this and I’m good, then this and I’m good,” then what you’re not doing is reading between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so for that, you really have to have a Socratic discussion, you have to have a sort of more, you have to have the back and forth, right in the OSSTM model of pentesting, we’re talking about induction, right we induce the system to do a certain thing based on input that we send. Right. And so that doesn’t come from the checklist. That’s not on the paper. You have to do that part. So you have to generate it yourself. You have to generate what it is that you want the system to respond to. And you’re not going to get that in, I think, most classes where this is primarily stuff that is being taught to a test so that you can get a certification so that you can get a job and therefore, so that you can have a career switch and change, you know, and again, I’m not going to tell an individual “don’t do that, that’s bad.” But I am saying that that’s not going to lead then to societal change. That’s not—or at least I should say, that is, at best, insufficient for the kind of radical changes that a group like Tech Learning Collective was based to help inspire. So that’s why everything from there has to be a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Teaching people who have been through any portion of the education system to like read between the lines is so critical. Teaching them to like, try stuff, to not doubt themselves, like…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: We teach like little kids and grandmas how to use Photoshop most of the time. So like, and even we’re like, consistently trying to do that to be like, “No, no, just try it. Just mess with it.” Like—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: I’ll be really proud of you if you break it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Yeah, if you break this file, go for it, I’ve got another copy, don’t worry.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: That’s a huge part for technology, particularly for digital technology particularly, right, because a lot of people are so accustomed to an experience in which if they fuck up, something is there in forever broken. Like maybe they’ve lost some data in the file or something, right, or their browser crashed. And that’s sort of a real visceral experience in the digital realm. But the reason that happens is because they’re not they’re treating digital like analog, right, and they’ve never been taught about the actual like what hypermedia really means. Tech Learning Collective says that “we teach students the arts of hyper media Information Technology and radical political practice,” all-in-one. And the notion there right is that a digital calendar is not an analog calendar, right? A file, like there’s no desks in your computer. We call it the “Desktop Environment.” But, your computer might be on a desk but, it’s not! It’s not actually a desk. There’s no desk in the computer. It’s not like that Zoolander moment where like, “Oh, the files are in the computer!” You know, that’s not, that’s not real.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And yet we have all these graphical symbols, right? Like folder icons and paper icons with little curls on them to sort of give us this metaphor that we’re dealing with something analog. And these metaphors weren’t inevitable, right? This isn’t necessarily how today’s computers had to be. Right? Look at, for example, the 60’s presentation with Engelbart and the way that he’s using that so called mouse or pre-mouse, right? It’s almost like an instrument. And he describes it as an instrument, actually, right. The keyboard is an instrument. It’s more musical than that. And so, when people today look at their computer, right, they’re often seeing an environment that they already have these associations with, not just with physical objects, but with physical objects that are useful in a particular context, which is primarily the office job, because that’s where, right, the industrialization of Business Machines really came from. Look at for example, IBM, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Paperless office.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so that’s why we have write things like file icons on graphical GUIs, that you sort of are, in that, try to help you understand what this object can do or what properties of this object are. But that’s just a metaphor. Right? And so we should think of the entire desktop environment as really a metaphor, because that’s what it is. The terminal is a different metaphor, right? So that is a chatroom metaphor. It’s an assistant metaphor, right? Back in the day, before we had sort of computers, before we thought of computers as physical objects, “computers” was the job title of mostly women who were basically secretarial, right, labor, and they were computers. That’s what their job title was. I’m a computer for IBM. That’s what they said. That was their job role. And the reason, right, that we now have a command line, right, is because that command line became that job role. That’s not that people, you know, in the political spectrum. “Oh my gosh, automation. Things are terrible.” I’m like, yes automation, and things are terrible. But like automation doesn’t have to be terrible, right? The terrible thing about automation is that the person whose job you’re automating the system doesn’t give a shit about, right? We could care about that person and offer a huge range of other things for them to do, not least of which is just be in a community and be social with other people, which is its own value. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that we’re against the whole notion of jobs—we’re not, I should say, against helping you find a job. Obviously, if you come to these workshops and learn these skills, it can help you get a job. But the point is that that’s not really our goal. And the reason for that is because we think it’s barbaric to have a society in which you have to work for somebody else, in order to have the basic dignity of shelter and food. That’s insane in 2020 with the technologies that we have available today, it’s absolutely ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: That how important your job is, you know, defines the level of healthcare you get.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, exactly, that even your job is tied to healthcare, which again, you know, big issue now in the pandemic, we’re the only industrialized nation in the world. Right? “Industrialized,” I should say in quotes, where that’s even sort of…everyone else thinks that’s insane! Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: I’m—right. This is the thing we get on all the time. That, like, we as a country and like capitalism inherently doesn’t value the people and that’s so short sighted because you do so much long term good when you invest in your people, when you invest in your citizens, because then they’re going to come up with like, amazing stuff that the system would never produce on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Jaron Lanier just the other day was talking about this in his keynote, right where he was saying that the Deming model of production basically said, Hey, you know, these are humans who are in factories, why don’t we ask these humans about what the best way to do their job is and they will probably come up with some examples of things that we can improve. And then that became the Toyota model, right, of for example, Kaizen. And that was now what we talk about as [the genesis of] Agile software development. So these concepts of like human dignity are really ingrained in Just the history of what we could have made possible with computers, but chose not to. And I suppose when I say we here, I mean, you know, the powers that be at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so it’s really important for people to understand, I think that, you know, the systems that we have today are not bad systems inso far as they don’t work, that they are not intentionally built this way. But it’s exactly the opposite, right? It’s not like we have a broken system. It’s that we have a system that explicitly chose to do these things in these ways, because it benefits people who were able to bend the will of others to that end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Of course, yeah, of course, it’s a feature, right? If you are, for example, taught to only think of your desktop environment in the context of your office job, you’re never going to think about what power you have at the tip of your fingertips to build something other than what your employer says is necessary for you to keep your job. And that’s really what we’re about. So that’s also why don’t we don’t focus on things like coding so much, but rather on sysops and system administration and DevOps and sort of all the infrastructural components, network engineering and security. That’s really the focus of Tech Learning Collective, specifically because it’s not a good place to start building a new world if you have to build it on the infrastructure of a one that is designed to hurt you. Right, you have to build a different infrastructure. And from a technology perspective, from a hacker perspective, right, that means things like self-hostability, re-decentralization, and all these sort of fancy buzzwords that we talked about at HOPE, and elsewhere for many years now, right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we’ve seen that that doesn’t, or that hasn’t historically been very successful, right. I think Aelon Porat put it in an earlier talk at HOPE 2020 pointed out very bluntly that like the advocacy community, for example, digital privacy rights advocates, haven’t been historically very successful, which is his very diplomatic way of saying failed miserably to get a lot of people to understand the criticality of data privacy and security. And so, again, that’s where we sort of have this schism, as Tech Learning Collective, with a lot of these other sort of tech initiative groups or these NGOs, a lot of these sort of, you know, sort of policy focused endeavors. We think policy is important but insufficient, and ultimately without resources placed in things like truly we would go so far to say insurrectionary infrastructures, we think it’s also doomed. And so that’s why we focus primarily on helping people who are already starting from the mindset of what can I do to radically change how my life is organized in the society and how society sort of creates the building blocks of mutual self regard for one another, right, with the tools that, you know, we have available and for us because we’re hackers, that means technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And it turns out technology is actually a really fantastic vehicle for this because never before in the history of humanity has a single individual had as much asymmetric power as we do today, right? 50 really competent hackers can in fact do the same things as what used to take 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 human individuals to do. And that’s becoming more true the more we attach the IoT, right, Internet of Things, to power plants and to, you know, shopping carts and whatever Amazon else is doing. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so we have to think really, about what environment that mean, what does that mean for activism? Because the old ways no longer work. If we live in a world of a global passive adversary, like the NSA for example, we have to think through what strategies may have been useful in 2010 or 2000 that are no longer useful in 2020. And you know, Bruce Schneier talks about this, another speaker at HOPE, where he talks about the security gap as a concept where there’s like a sliding window of things you can do as a small nimble organization, right, that a larger, sort of, more entrenched entity, like a government or like a corporation, right, multinational corporations and governments are kind of the same thing really, today, there’s so much collaboration between the two of them that it’s a little bit ridiculous to sort of talk about one without the other. But if you can sort of stay in that security gap, then you can actually effect change in a way that is far outsized, based on how small your number is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And that’s really all we need. We don’t need right 100% participation in sort of social change, like we do with maybe mask use, right? What we actually need is something like maybe 5% participation, there’s some statistic that I’ve never looked up to see if it’s true, because it makes me really happy and I don’t want to know that it’s not true that the Civil Rights movement was participated in by only 2% of the United States’s adult population. And if that’s true, then that shows you, right, that, that really, it’s not about getting the masses or changing hearts and minds. We don’t really care about that. Because that’s not actually what’s going to make larger change. What’s actually going to make larger change is committed groups of competent individuals who understand the reality in which they exist today, learn from the past, but don’t replicate the past in, you know, in order to create these more autonomous and more self governing and more, you know, you know, for those who, for those whom this word is not already tainted, a more anarchistic future because that’s actually what the internet was that we all like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This whole decentralized Internet that we miss? That was effectively an anarchic construction. And if we can apply that, just in sort of an understanding of the of the political implications, the imbued politics of what that was, whether it was intentional or not, but the structure of it, to how we are trying to work today, we should match our social behaviors or social constructions to the technical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right now, that’s not the case. You have to go to maybe France or Tennessee, right? If you want to talk to someone who’s literally next door over Facebook. Why? Because you have to transit your ISP, which then goes to an Internet backbone, which then ends up at a CDN, which then ends up at Facebook servers, and then comes all the way back so that you can talk to the person that’s in the room that’s next to you. That’s absurd from any kind of, from any position of—the only way that’s not absurd is how do I centralize or create toll roads for this particular traffic so that I can then create choke points and control that communication, right? It’s clearly more—it’s useful, if that’s your perspective, which is the perspective of Verizon, and the NSA and so on and so forth, and Facebook, right. It’s not the perspective of the actual person. So there’s this misalignment between the ways that the system is built infrastructurally and what people actually want to do with it, actually want it to do for them. And the only way to realign those, in our opinion, is not through laws because laws follow behavior, they don’t they don’t preceed behavior. Laws are the code of conduct that we all are sort of socially bound to, but doesn’t actually prevent us for from doing something that only punishes us if we don’t do something or reward us if we do do something. So laws follow behavior, they don’t preempt behavior. That sort of thing, just as a, if you take that as a given.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so the way to do this, right, is to, in the same way that we have, for example, many, many, many electricians and many, many, many plumbers and many, many trade, you know, workers and people so-called “essential workers,” right, whose lives apparently the government could care less about because ALEC, right now, is lobbying for anti-Coronavirus, death lawsuits, right? They’re trying to claim that they don’t have liability if employers kill their workers because of coronavirus. So, there’s that happening. But the point is, is that we have so few relative to how many other essential workers, we have so few sysadmins relative to how many other essential workers we have, that in our view, the much more important thing, much more important than learning JavaScript or learning how to code or learning how to make a back end, you know, three-tier website or whatever—Anytime someone says, “web app” I just can’t stop thinking “surveillance apparatus”—but anyway, right, much more important than that is who is building the infrastructure? Who’s controlling that? Because if you want to actually re-decentralize the Internet, you need more sysadmins than you have now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You actually need people to at least understand that when they turn on the faucet in their bathroom, that water doesn’t just magically appear there and and at the, at the drain. That there’s something before and something after they see the water in their sink. Right. And similarly—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: The world doesn’t go away when you close your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Precisely. And so that’s just as true with technology and with the bits that’s transiting over your network link, as it is with water. And that means we need the equivalent plumbers and electricians. And so that’s how we approach things like teaching system administration and network engineering. And that’s not glamorous, right, like that’s a humble position to put us to put a technologist in. And if you look at, for example, the amount of money that jobs like, for example, you know, senior engineering managers or even for instance, developers, right, are making in comparison to what electricians and plumbers are making. You see a very clear difference in class. Right? There’s a huge amount more money if you are for example, running a, or coding, you know, the Twitter UI, right, then if you are making sure that the building in which that those programmers were working before Coronavirus, or even now at their homes, right, has electricity. If you’re the electrician for that person, you’re not making probably as much. If you’re the plumber for that person, you’re probably making even less.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We value water even less than electricity which is weird because we’re gonna have a water crisis, right, coming up in the next five to 15 years. And you know, we can live without electricity for many, many, many days, we can live without water for only maybe two or three. So the entire economic incentive schemes are also inverted, badly so. Right? And that, you know, will require not only an understanding of sort of this system as, as something that these choices were sort of, that these were actually chosen, choices people made, and that they weren’t mistakes, that these weren’t bad choices. This is the point of creating a status symbol that’s associated with the kind of jobs that technologists have.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to say that technologists don’t deserve the praise for doing the work that they do. What I am saying is that plumbers electricians deserve just as much praise. As technologists, we have to lift that up. And so when we approach teaching about system administration and network engineering as a trade, rather than as some sort of like high tech, laudable skill, for us, that’s a sign of huge respect, rather than diminishing the skill that it is, because it’s just as important in the information age to have the flow of communications be well monitored, secured, you know, reliable, available, you know, integrious, right, the CIA triad that we talk about: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability principles from the infosec world, right? That is stuff that any Junior System Administrator should know. But typically, even if you’re in the tech field, you don’t really hear about those infosec concepts until you’re already bluntly brainwashed by an educational institution that’s trying to make sure that you are taking part and parcel of the perverted incentives that ends up with you having a CCNP or an OSCP certification that then gets you you know, $200,000 a year and that you are now divorced from the community that you might have even came from. Right? And that you’re no longer really incentivize to give back to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So that’s an extractive model in the same way that we think about, for example, rare earth minerals being extracted from mines and sort of strip mining of land. And that being a horrific thing for the environment, there’s a similar thing happening with code boot camps and with the educational system around technical skill, because now those extractive models are being applied to people, and those “human resources” as we weirdly call them, right, are being treated in exactly that same way. Let’s take out everyone who wants to—let’s take out from communities, everyone who wants to learn about technology and put them in the the sort of like power generators of Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Right? In order to mine more data, we literally call it “data mining” from those exact same communities. And yeah, there are some exceptions, of course, where, you know, an extraordinary person will go through this thing and end up with, you know, with huge success and create an NGO, but now their left hand is fighting their right hand. So where’s the infrastructure that’s different than this, to actually make something else?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And that’s again, what because, you know, we know there are sort of here or there, there’s, there’s some good examples. And again, you know, NGOs are doing some amount of good work, but they’re still beholden to the same system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So we see ourselves as kind of like the separatist group of, of hacker educators that came with this analysis and are trying to do something completely different. And that, for us, currently, in this phase of our, because of the history that I was talking about earlier, starts from this notion of, we need more sysadmins, and so we have to make them by educating them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And it turns out, there’s actually a lot of people who are interested in that exact thing. They don’t often know it most people who come to TLC come because they want to “learn how to code.” And then once they see the power in a couple of workshops, of all the other things that are there, like once they see that, oh my god, I don’t even really know what a socket was, but I was doing network programming this whole time. Okay, well, let’s talk about, you know, the network layers. You know, let’s talk about the OS. Let’s talk about Unix domain sockets. Here’s another way, right? In fact, if you’re a security minded person, you know that if you are looking at a server that’s running on your machine, for example, an Nginx machine, right next server, you might want to use something like a Unix domain socket, because it could be, in some context, way more secure than using a TCP socket. But you have to know what that is. Right? And if you if you’ve never heard the term socket, because you’ve only maybe heard the term WebSocket, or you only ever heard the term, you know, web server, because you’re only ever coding, then you can never even code well for that context. So anyway, that’s our that’s our that’s our spiel. That was a bit of a rant, I hope that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: I’m so excited to know you exist now, because you’ve just touched on in like 20 minutes, like three days worth of conversations we’ve been having here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Oh, awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Like, utility issues and issues with protests and racism and just trying to get people to see that no, this system is designed to be this way. It’s designed to like, like, capitalism doesn’t work without an underclass the way we have it set up. Yeah, like, all of these huge, huge issues that like, deeply bother like almost everyone I’ve met under 40. And you just have them all here at the front of like your thing like, you guys are really exciting. I’m like really excited to know you exist. I can’t wait to spend like a week crawled up inside your website.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Please, that would be really cool. It’s exciting for me to hear about your excitement because normally this is not the kind of conversation that well, I should say this: it is becoming more frequently the kind of conversation that, you know, ends up with the sort of excitement of what let’s do something and how do we kind of do that next. But for a long time, I will say that like you know, this was not generally speaking the kind of conversation that was that—I’m hesitating a little bit to say welcome, but, for lack of a better word, I’ll say welcome in spaces that were primarily technical, right. And I think that it’s important to remember that even though that, that, you know, it, this comes back to that sort of cultural divide, right, like a lot of people had some, a lot of, you know, “technical” people insofar as again, there’s this distinction between technical and non technical, but, um, there’s a lot of folks who, you know, may not—they have this sort of intuitive sense of like, this is sort of wrong, or this is not how I want the Internet to be or something, you know, like something went awry somewhere. But what they don’t, I think, realize is that part of what, at least when at least part of what went awry, if not, most of it is that most of the people who are actually really lucky from the 90s in the in the early 2000s. Right, the an earlier generation of hackers. They didn’t do a lot of teaching in comparison to how much basically employing they did, right. And so there’s a huge culpability in that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That’s not to paint every hacker community as something that is sort of evil, obviously, because there’s, you know, there’s epistemic forces, and systemic forces, and individual horses, and they all have their own, you know, sort of shares of this thing. But it is to say that if we, like Aelon Porat said earlier, right, like, we’ve done a bad job as a hacker community, primarily, and I think part of it, you know, even Moxie Marlinspike blogged about this in the early days of TextSecure, where he was like, I looked around and all of a sudden, these sort of people I was making fun of for coming to DEF CON from the military are now basically running the show what the hell happened? It’s like a blink of an eye. But really what happened was, and he points this out, right, is we didn’t pay attention, that was a huge mistake. And so we lost that security gap moment, right? Where the cyberpunk future we envision where we could actually have privacy, where nations were no longer important, look at “beauty of the baud”, and Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace, and Hacker Manifesto, right, from Phrack days. We lost that. We basically just fumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: We showed them our hand and they took it away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Literally dropped the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Right! And now if you want to go into security, right, what’s the only legal way to do that? Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Yeah, you have to go through the training and get the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: And what do we call that? What’s the name for…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Indoctrination?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Well, I mean, yes, but I was thinking what do they they call it? Right, that the word for hacking legally?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Is that pentesting now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah. And that, it is. That’s right. And that practice, they call it “ethical hacking.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Mm hmm. Right. Right. Certified Ethical Hacking?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yes. Think of the perversion of language. How 1984 is that? You can’t get more doublespeak than this. It’s literally the the epitome of hacker doublespeak to call that ethical hacking. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: It’s like when I figured out as a child that, no you don’t get to be an astronaut without joining the military.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Right. So they have this monopoly of violence that they’ve now extended into the cyber realm they explicitly talk about in those terms, and anything other than a direct confrontation with that, ideologically, I mean, is not enough to overcome it. Because you cannot have something that is anathema to the very existence of other ideas and claim that that is in any way inclusive or diverse. It’s just not possible, you have to actually put a stake in the ground at some point, in order for things that are opposed to that ideology, to have a chance. The only ideology—and the thing about that, is that any ideology other than one of diversity, right, is one against diversity, by definition, and so if you actually believe in that the thing about your so called inclusive ideology that you must maintain as a red line, your line in the sand, is you cannot allow anything that is anti-diverse in that. It must not be permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: So I have a question from the Discord. This person asking is a teaching adjunct who teaches creative tech and web tech at a large university. And they’re looking, they’re hoping you might know of any talks or video clips or good ways of discussing the corporate state of the web that you think can aid in illustrating the decentralized nature of its origins to Gen Z?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Oh, that’s a really good question. Um, I happen to really like a book called A Prehistory of The Cloud. It’s by an MIT author, Asian American, whose name I’m blanking on right now, but we can look it up. But it’s MIT Press, A Prehistory of The Cloud. It talks a lot about where the current notion of the Internet, as we know it today in terms of cloud services, and, you know, the sort of massive centralized companies that are running data centers, where it came from. And it’s a good read, it’s not the only thing that I think is relevant along those lines, but it’s probably one of the best primers and starters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another really good book, and I think this is sort of maybe a little askew to the question, but is an approach that we take Tech Learning Collective very often, which is to simply use different metaphors when we talk about the technologies that we have and a good book for this is one by Eric Davis known as Techgnosis, T-E-C-H-G-N-O-S-I-S. Techgnosis, as in the Gnostic traditions of technology. Because if you look back far enough in places like for example, Ethernet networking, when Bob Metcalfe created Ethernet, right, the name Ethernet was not a mistake. It was not just, you know, this is what we call it. Now, we don’t even think about where you know what an Ethernet is, but in the early 20th century and the 19th century, right, the notion of “the ether” was an idea that came from the Gnostic traditions that there were these, there was this thing, almost like The Force in Star Wars, right? Where it, where this thing called ether permeated everything and everyone, it was sort of part of what held the universe together. And so when Metcalfe was trying to come up with a universal networking technology, he used that word to describe his Ethernet technology because it was going to be a network of devices that held other networks together. And now of course, we have Ethernet as sort of the de facto layer two networking technology in any network you can think of, more or less. And that came from this sort of like, gnostic metaphor of the ether.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so when we teach at Tech Learning Collective, mostly what we do is we go back to the sort of early metaphors and early understandings of what was possible rather than what is in its concrete form now because that opens up the imagination of students to think about what they could do with the capabilities that we teach them in sort of the later half of workshops and courses. So when we talk about networking, for example, we talk about the notion of a relatively ubiquitous, magical, right, like Force-like, ability that we now have, right? When you’re browsing a website, you’re not, you know, we think of it as saying for example, you’re visiting a website, you’re going someplace, but really what it’s more like, if you look at the technologies, you’re conjuring you’re bringing, you’re pulling to you, you’re downloading&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: The mountains coming to Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Right? If you want to use the Dune analogy, right, you’re like folding space so that you end up, right, or rather, it ends up in the place where you are. And so whatever metaphor you want to use, right, starting to use, a more poetic, a more, a more fantastical language, I mean, even the terms of programming today, right? In the 90s, we had this sort of big shift towards industrial language with Java and sort of factory patterns and this kind of stuff when we talk about programming, but if you look at the words that were used to describe elements of syntax and code, for example, the dollar sign in a bash variable, right? That’s known as a sigil. A programming sigil, right, is a specific glyph that is used to denote something magical about the word following that particular symbol. And the word sigil comes from magic. It comes from literal, like, you know, like witch and wizard magic. And so if you return the magic to computers, and I think that’s relatively easy to do, because a lot of people do think of them almost as magical devices, then you open up the imagination for students to think about what else could have been possible rather than just sort of accepting this received notion of what is now and therefore sort of what other people have already to, you know, use the word that’s now been used several times, right, indoctrinated people to think should be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so a good book for that as Techgnosis. A good, more technical book around these things, sort of historical context, is A Prehistory of The Cloud. There are others but those are two pretty good ones as well. Obviously, I would also highly recommend Jaron Lanier’s works, you know, the keynote speaker from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: That’s, that is awesome. That is a great resource list.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: I was always surprised that people didn’t call Wi-Fi sub ether.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, or any other new, or even radio, right, just in general, when when we think about—the other thing that we like to do with Tech Learning Collective that I think is also a missed opportunity in other places is sort of this more foundational look at the technologies that we have. So for instance, when we talk, we don’t have to go into physics too much, right, to understand how Wi-Fi works. But it’s interesting to think about radio as basically just electricity in the air, right? Because those same sort of, the when you look at for example, electric current you’re looking at, for example, a radio wave, you’re still seeing at the physics level, those same sort of like IQ, you know, spinning, you know sine waves that you’re talking about when you look at at the physics side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: The more we learn, the more we learn about it, the more we go, no electromagnetism, they are more tied together than we could possibly imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, there aren’t that many kinds of energy or matter that, you know, humans know how to use in the world, right? There’s, you know, light, there’s sound vibration, which is physics, right. And there’s electromagnetism or energy, right? Or electrical energy of that kind. And that’s also radio. And so when people, for example, understand that that’s what wireless is. Wireless is radio. That’s it. Right? Then they can understand the electromagnetic spectrum. And they can have an understanding that’s more intuitive of, for example, a 2.4 gigahertz radio and maybe an 800 megahertz cell tower. Right? So that now that makes more sense, because it’s actually just the same physical matter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so again, when we start networking courses, we talk about physical links, right? That’s where we need to start. So that you know how things are connected. Why do we need physical links? Well, because right, we live in a physical world and computers still live in this physical world. So as magical as I just described it is, right, the other side of that coin and sort of at the same time, there’s sort of a, you know, there’s a challenge in this for teachers, because you have to sort of, on the one hand, give the analogy give the sort of magical or metaphorical side of things, but then also compromise it at the same time. And so, if we’re doing these, these two tasks, but it’s in much the same way that, for example, science and religion is often, you know, viewed as opposites when they’re not, right, we have this sort of weird cultural understanding of opposites. Like dog and cat. Those are not opposites at all. Right? they’re actually just two different species of animals. But similarly, like, science and religion might be seen as opposite. There might be some tension involved in that but they’re not opposites. And so likewise, if we look at for example, radio, and you know, understanding that any wireless technology is ultimately radio, now, right if you talk about for example, a cable right, so we have like an ethernet, with an RJ-45 jack cable, right, where you are, a Registered Jack 45 where you have a you know you have an eight line ethernet cable, connects from one computer to another. Right you turn off the Wi-Fi link, you can still talk to them their computer, but now you’re talking over physical cable. Well inside that physical cable, it’s just basically radio on copper. Right? Or whatever. Fiber? Well, not fiber, as that’s light. But on copper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: It’s a modern telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, exactly. It is a modern telegraph. And that it’s actually the same thing as the telegraph just for the new way. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, it’s a very efficient telegraph. And so, so we need that physical link because whether we’re doing it wirelessly or physically, right, whether it be radio waves, or sort of radio on the cable, like cable, electricity, electrical link, there’s still actually a link. A physical link.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And so, in order to talk to, for example, Facebook, there must be a physically unbroken link whether that is entirely over a copper cabling, or if some bits of that link end up being over the air via radio. Right? There’s still a physical process happening from me to Facebook. And that’s just the same as if, for example, you’re 12 years old, and you are trying to talk to your friend across the street with a can and string. Drop the can, and you can no longer talk, right? Or, for example, with light and ships in the sea, right? If there is not a physical way for that light to reach you, you don’t have line of sight, right? When you’re doing Morse code on the sea, you’re not going to get the message. This is just as true in computers as it is everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So really understanding those foundations is what makes it really easy for people to pick up and sort of apply that knowledge to other realms, which means that they don’t have to spend 20 years, you know, at a job to get good at a particular set of skills. And I think that’s the other thing that people sort of mistake. Another thing I like to say is that, you know, there’s a lot of this feeling of being overwhelmed when people come to TLC. There’s a lot of, you know, how am I ever going to learn this stuff? There’s so much and yeah, there’s a lot, but it’s not like there’s thousands of years of human history and like craftsperson-ship to learn you know, and become really good at, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s not like you have to learn about if you were learning herbalism or cooking or you know literature, you’ve got thousands and thousands of years of human history to catch up on as someone who was born in 2000, right, or 2005, whatever. Now, if you’re, from today, if you are looking to be good at technology, which is to say digital technologies, right computer technologies, you’ve got maybe 70, 80 years, you know, meaningfully of history to catch up on and you can totally do that in a committed two to three year stint, right? That’s not nothing. It’s still work, but it’s not a rest of your life endeavor. It’s far from it. And so this notion of like, only the, you know, super committed, you know, people who’ve been doing this for their whole lifetime since the age of 12. You know, back in the 80’s could get good at it. That’s absurd. That’s ridiculous. The only reason it takes so long, typically for so many people is because they don’t have the resources because most of their resources are spent right trying to get their employer’s problems  solved, not their own problem solved. They don’t have the guidance. Because again, right, I mean, I used to work in the IT industry, I quit after—I hated it for several reasons. But the point is that, like, I remember employers constantly promising things like professional development courses and time off for learning, and I never got that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: I mean, it’s, it’s an endemic issue in the industry. So there’s that. And so they don’t have that. And then also, on top of all that, they don’t have good resources when they go looking for something because it’s either the black hole of YouTube or blog searches that have become worse and worse and worse over time, or answers that don’t actually tell you about the underlying technologies that you’re trying to look up. They tell you how to solve the problem. They tell you how to, you know, like, you know, copy and paste this code from Stack Overflow is the programmers example, or here the two commands that you need is the sysadmins example. Right? But they don’t actually tell you why it works.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Erin: I can’t tell you how many threads I’ve read for hours and hours and hours that say “solved” and at the bottom, it’s by a new Mac. That’s the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah. And so that too, right, that comes from the sort of like, let me give you the worksheet to follow, the checklist to do the thing, like, let me give you the playbook without necessarily explaining to you or showing you, letting you go under the hood of that same playbook. That’s up to you. And, look, most people don’t have the time to do that, because most people are doing this in the context of a job where they’ve already got these other pressures, which, again, is why we don’t focus on people who are trying to get careers or jobs from this, not again, not to say that you can’t or shouldn’t, but that, you know, that’s not our focus. And because it’s not our focus, it means that we have a lot of space and a lot of resources to do the sorts of education that actually gets you a foundational knowledge base from which you can then, you know, do whatever you want, really, because that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For us, it’s about autonomy building, not about sort of, it’s not even about personal empowerment, right? That’s great. We want that but personal empowerment leads to “Well, I’m gonna get a $200,000 a year job and then you know, work for Palantir.” That’s not really the goal here. The real goal is if you know these skills, and you’re in an environment where you’re apprenticing right? Or learning with other people who know these skills with some way of sort of sharing ideologies around this. And this is can be anything from like, super hardcore, radical anarchist political stuff, all the way to, isn’t it cool that programming languages use magical terms like sigil? And let’s talk about that! And let’s make a pagan group around computer use, for example, that’s also another way to sort of build autonomy. But it’s not just about you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: I’d love to spend more time with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: I know it’s probably, we’re probably running out of time. But thank you so much for letting me talk about this and for asking the questions you did and for inviting us to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: I do have one more question if you have another few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Oh, sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Any thoughts on how the discuss the shift from the web being a disembodied anonymous space to one made of profiles tied directly to your real life identity, and all the ways that has impacted queer and radical subculture on the net?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Whoo, that is a that is a whole other hour, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Right, so much silencing, like, just like the Facebook real name requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah. So I think—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Radio Statler producer: We don’t have anything coming up the next hour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Like, yeah, we have time. I don’t know if you do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: I actually have, I’m booked to teach a workshop actually in about half an hour, so I have to go soon. But I can stay for a little bit longer. So maybe we’ll go until another maybe 10-15? And then I really have to rush.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: Yeah, cool. You’d be delighted to have you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Well, hey, thanks for the extended invitation then, um, but so the answer this person’s question, or maybe not to answer, but maybe to think about a little bit, I think it’s important to recognize the sort of cause and effect that we’re seeing. Right, like what that person describing is a, is an effect of something that came before. Right. And you mentioned the Facebook Real Name requirements, right? That is a, you know, a choice Facebook made and they knew what they were doing when they when they made it. I don’t necessarily think that they made it maliciously, I’m not trying to inscribe intent there, although, you know, we can certainly have a debate about whether or not it was malicious. And I might fall on that side. But that doesn’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The point is they had reasons, right? And they weighed those reasons. And they made a specific choice. And so the question we have to ask ourselves is, why is it that the Internet sort of at large, and we know it today, and the people who are sort of responsible for making decisions on the Internet has consistently seem to make choices that hurt queer and marginalized and racialized populations? And so on right? Because there is a clear pattern that that has been true. So what’s going on with that? Like, what why is that sort of the decisions? Why do things keep falling on that side?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And I think one of the most important, I think, philosophical notions to think about, or lenses from which we can think about that is that we perceive ourselves, right, to have this existence in society that is democratic, lowercase D democratic so, Okay, so what is democracy? Right? Well, one person, one vote sort of thing, right? And the fact of the matter is that we don’t actually live in a country in America anyway. Right? The United States, it’s not really a democracy, it’s really a Republic. Right? You don’t actually vote for the president, you vote for an elector who then votes for the President. Right. So you vote for representative. And so there’s this huge effort amongst primarily liberal policies to get more representation, right. Whether it be media, whether it be in politics, through electors, or Congress, people, Congress Critters and so on, right. And the problem there is that you have indirection, right? You are not actually in control with anything, you are only indirectly able to influence something. So that’s Problem number one, we don’t really live in a democracy. We live in a sort of Republic system of government.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Number two is let’s say we did live in democracy, right. So now we know that just imagine that there weren’t in any sort of indirect intermediaries that we actually had full and like immediate control over the the levers of power through our votes. Well now right, we have a way one person one vote scenario where you know, the power is in the hands of any majority. But we know that that’s also not the best way to structure a society if you are not a majority, right? If you are the minority, then you clearly don’t have, you know, that’s not the best necessarily situation for, you know. Now, you can maybe hope for, you know, the kindness of other people and the generosity of the majority so that they don’t crush you at the ballot box, but ultimately, from a technologist point of view, we understand that that’s a promise not not really a implemented right aspect of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And we can have reasonable debates about whether or not that’s good or bad or whether or not, you know that that’s sufficient. But if you look at it from the perspective of tech, right that a hacker would look at it, we have to think about, is this susceptible to a failure mode that an attacker would take advantage of? And the obvious answer is, it is, right? There is no system on Earth, in which humans interact with where its input will be given by people who all have the same intent. Right? And so, now we have to think about, okay, if democracy itself, right, as in one person, one vote, majority rule, will everyone describe it is not going to serve us in this way? How do we build systems which can?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And I think that that first shift, right, we are so far away. Most people think, right in America that we live in a democracy that you know, you elect the president, and this is so far away from how it actually works, that there’s this sort of pre-work that has to happen to just educate people about what reality they’re actually living in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And this is something that hackers should be very good at, because the whole notion right of hacking should be to show people what’s possible, rather than what’s polite. Right? Here, I can do this! Maybe you didn’t want me to do it. That’s possible. Look, I used this thing in a different way, or I subverted this rule. Right, again, Bruce Schneier says that hacking is about subverting rules. So using the current context, or the current rule set, right, in a way that the system, the system’s designers didn’t expect. That is a hack, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Also, by the way, there’s a great piece I think it was published on Aeon.com at some point recently, or a couple years ago, it was called “How Yuppies Hacked the Hacker Ethos.” And it’s a great piece about this sort of, this, dillusion of the term “hacking,” which has now sort of become like, you know, you’re a hacker, if you, for example, work at the Google offices and you know, you work on protobuf or something, maybe. Not to single that out, in particular, like, that’s cool, right. protobuf is great, or whatever it is, right, that you want to work on. You used to work on Google Wave. You hacked together a new product. Fantastic, great. That’s not what it originally meant. And that’s not to say that it can’t mean that I know language evolves and all that stuff. But the point is, is that it we sort of lost this more you know, beauty of the baud style ethos from the 90s of what hacking could have been for us. Not even to say that the 90s was was great that was already after the period in the 80s when women were told that, you know, for example, that they shouldn’t deal with math and computers, because only that’s, that’s boy stuff. So that’s already exactly not a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the point is, is that that’s, you know, you want to go back through these these thoughts, whether it is historically, you know, through a chronology to find some place where you can fork, right? Like, if you look at the GitHub history, and you see like, well, I don’t really like what happened after this commit. Fine, fork from the previous commit, and then start again, right? We don’t have to always append to the things that came before us in the technical realm. We shouldn’t have to then—we should be able to jettison the things that we don’t like culturally as well. And so for us, it’s like, Okay, well, for me, personally, I should say, right. I love this notion of Metcalfe’s Ethernet, this sort of magical permeating network, this sort of Solarpunk vision of technology working with people. Jaron Lanier, again, talked a lot about how there was this debate about whether AI—Artificial Intelligence—was going to replace humans, or whether AI—Augmented Intelligence—right, or Aggregate Intelligence, was going to sort of provide a mechanism for humans to work more closely with other humans in increasingly collaborative ways. And that was a debate that was happening in the 70’s. So I like those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And I think that, you know, a lot of stuff that happened in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s, that was this sort of very industrial very, you know, we basically industrialized, all the ideas that that that didn’t have to be industrialized, right? Again, Java, as a programming language has enormous amount of metaphor in it. And it’s, and its metaphor is the factory. Literally, there’s a there’s a programming concept called the factory pattern, right? Where you generate a bunch of objects based on an on one another object that’s a generator for that object, right? In Python, we have generators. In JavaScript now we have generators, right? And again, where did these words come from? What was the mindset of the people who made those choices to call it that? And again, it’s not a I’m not blaming them as individuals but I am saying that they lived in a context where they made certain choices that then we never questioned 10 years, 20 years later. But we could! We can!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And if we do, that we can do the same, you know, for these for these concepts, we can do the same thing with these other sort of more abstract notions of things like democracy, right? Do we really want a one vote one, one, you know, one person, one vote system directly, right? In a world where any Sybil attack can be 100,000 people? Probably not a good choice as an infrastructure to build a society or a voting society, because you have bad actors that can then take advantage of that as a vulnerability. So, you know, I’m not gonna, say this is the answer. But I am going to say that I think that if you approach it in that sense, then you look at the choices people like Facebook make, and you can clearly see the motivations behind it. And you can even understand and empathize with those motivations, even as they harm you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Right, us as queer people, right, us as poor people, Facebook is harming us. There’s no question about that. But I understand exactly where they’re coming from. And I have to understand where they’re coming from in order to come up with any means that has a chance in hell of combating it. Because if I don’t know my enemy, right, there’s no way I’m going to be able to strategize in a meaningful way. And so the more that you ask those questions, I think further away, you find yourself from solutions, like policy solutions, like, solutions like law, like hope, and solutions, like, for example, you know, relying on the kindness of a majority. And the further away you get from believing that these sort of naive notions of political systems such as you know, lowercase-d democracy, where you have a majority rule, are that ambitious or even worth aspiring to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And then and only then can you come up with, you know, can you start asking yourself questions like, “How should we really organize ourselves?” “What is what is an effective way?” And then once you ask yourself those questions, you have to experiment, and fail. A lot. Like a lot! Right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: That’s how you learn best, right? Through failure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah. And the other thing on that is that with TLC, right, the first thing one of the first things that we do when we when we create lab environments for folks is that we say we’re not even going to talk about doing something in the lab environment, we’re going to talk about creating the lab environment. And the reason for that is because when you fuck up—not if—but when you fuck up, it’s going to be okay because you did it in a safe area. And so that, that is you know, you have to be able to create environments for yourself where you can make mistakes where you can fail, and where it can be okay to do so. And I should say also, where it’s okay to do that non-publicly. Where it’s okay to fail private.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: That’s, that’s such a big piece of the classroom Erin and I try to build, too. We just, we try to give our students a place to fail, so they can learn more, so they can learn better so they can gain confidence and be willing to change try and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, that I think is one of the things that was the most damaging to what we would call, you know, capital TH The Hacker community, capital THC, The Hacker Community, in the 90s, where we had, you know, a lot of people being ridiculed for not knowing stuff. And I think there was this huge movement. Movement is maybe the wrong term, but there was a lot of motivation amongst people who were very technically skilled, but were not very emotionally mature, to raise themselves up by putting other people down. And that’s exactly the wrong approach for an empowering education. Of course, that wasn’t their intent, right? These weren’t self described teachers. So again, I empathize, and I understand, but it wasn’t perhaps a strategically good move. Because the result was those you know, military folks who everyone laughed at at the early DEF CONS, right? and you can hear. What’s the CloudFlare CEO’s name? Matthew something or other? Maybe it wasn’t him. Maybe I’m misnaming somebody, but I remember hearing a story where they were describing, you know, one of these CEOs, infosec CEOs, was describing going to DEF CON and, you know, he and his buddies were sort of laughing at the, at the army people who, like failed all the CTFs, they just didn’t know how to do anything. You know, like, haha, it’s gonna, you know, they don’t even know what they’re doing. And then literally, within five years, they were the top team or one of the top teams. And, you know, that’s got to be, you know, that that was an invasion. It was a cultural invasion. And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You know, when we put out when Tech Learning Collective hosted our first conference last December, within days of publishing it, we were approached by a military recruiter, and, you know, way earlier than we were approached by any queer group, you know. It took our side weeks to find us, but it took, you know, ostensible enemy’s side days. And so I think, we’ve ceded a lot of ground in that case. And I think that we have to think bigger than things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The, like all the supposedly ambitious statements that people are making, even these large national nonprofit groups where they’re like, you know, saying, Oh, you should, you know, you know, we have to ban facial recognition. Yes. Agree let’s ban facial recognition. But that’s, that’s such an unambitious goal. And it’s not that like, it’s a bad thing to do. There’s no reason for us to get in the way of that kind of effort. All we’re saying is that if you look strategically at where we’re going and how slow we’re making progress against this and how quickly our enemies’s capabilities and capacities are increasing, we have to pick a different prioritization of where our resources are going in order to have any hope of doing anything meaningful. And this sort of over reliance on policy, this over reliance on lowercase-d democracy, this over reliance on sort of the promises that our enemies are making to us is a doomed strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So, I don’t know if that answers the question, but I hope that gives us some sense of how to think maybe a little bit bigger about why it is that these choices continuously sort of hurt, you know, trans people, and queer people, and Black people, and Brown people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mel: It was it was really a wonderful education in and of itself, like, and I have a lot to think about. I think our listeners have a lot to think about. And I think we have a really good reading list. And I really appreciate you spending the extra time with us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;TLC: Yeah, thank you so much, again, for inviting me. I do have to get going because I’m teaching a networking class. So you know, if folks want to learn more: TechLearningCollective.com. We have an email address, PGP key, we also have a Signal number. We publish our Safety Number, our Signal Safety Number as well. So if you want to verify that before you send a Signal message to us, you could do so. We’ve got a couple of workshops coming up at HOPE. But also, again, if you go to TechLearningCollective.com and just click on the Events Calendar page, you’ll see either a list or a month view of all the events that we have coming up. Some are free, some are by donation, some are at cost, a sliding scale cost. We tend to limit class sizes to something that’s under 20 folks, because that helps discussion. We try to be, sort of, interactive with students, but we do a lot of them. So feel free to come to any of them, and please tell your friends, and if this kind of stuff speaks to you, either politically or philosophically or technically, you know, we’re here to make it possible to take those next steps after you begin, you know, finding an interest in this or after you begin maybe attending like your first digital security workshop or a CryptoParty or that, like, you know, “What next?” We hope that that answer is us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">In a far-reaching interview on the Hackers On Planet Earth 2020 conference's Internet radio broadcast, Radio Statler, Tech Learning Collective discusses our philosophical approach to computer technology, hacking, anarcho-autonomism, and more. We also lead three offensive cybersecurity workshops at the HOPE 2020 workshops track this year, made possible by the conference organizer's decision to make the event a wholly-virtual one. Our own hope for the event is that people who are looking for a liberatory and ambitious direction that goes beyond but overlaps with the famous hacker ethos exemplified by the HOPE 2020 conference and community can find what they're looking for in the form of Tech Learning Collective's approach to queering hackerdom and returning the magic to computers.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-hope-2020.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-hope-2020.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Student Profile Series: Satisfaction Brought it Back</title><link href="http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/14/student-profile-series-satisfaction-brought-it-back.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Student Profile Series: Satisfaction Brought it Back" /><published>2020-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/14/student-profile-series-satisfaction-brought-it-back</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/14/student-profile-series-satisfaction-brought-it-back.html">&lt;p&gt;For years now, Tech Learning Collective has been training students in technical skills that they’ve used for personal projects, career advancement, and activist organizing efforts. As society’s collective reliance on digital skills has skyrocketed, especially with more people forced to adopt distance-everything routines like “e-learning,” working from home, and online socializing, so too have &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/02/mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights.html&quot;&gt;we at Tech Learning Collective adapted&lt;/a&gt; how we teach. The most notable change is that we now teach solely online via Internet video conference, since all of our traditional classroom spaces have been forced to close either temporarily or, sadly, permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new online-only format means we’ve been able to reach many more students, which is itself a good opportunity to re-examine our processes and rethink some of how we do what we do. To that end, we invited some recently recurring students (those &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/05/19/as-tech-learning-collective-grows-quality-is-signature-of-classes-and-workshops.html#unwavering-comittment-to-our-mission&quot;&gt;students who have attended more than one workshop&lt;/a&gt; within the last five months) to speak with us about their backgrounds and experiences studying with Tech Learning Collective. Our goal was to collect qualitative data regarding the effectiveness of our Web site and other communications channels, understand why certain referral mechanisms are successful (or not), and generally improve our operational and educational process at every stage of a student’s learning path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the recordings, we felt that some of the interviews not only provided insight for us about who our newer students are and why they’re showing up again and again, but that the conversations could also be a valuable way for other current or prospective students to learn more about Tech Learning Collective itself, our history, our motivations, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about/#our-difference&quot;&gt;what makes us different&lt;/a&gt; from other educational resources available elsewhere. And so, with their permission, we’re choosing to publish some of those interviews in a sort of podcast-like blog series we’re calling the Tech Learning Collective Student Profile Series. We hope you enjoy listening to (or reading the transcript of) these conversations as much as we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first installment, we talk about nurturing the bloom of students’ curiosity, how to overcome the challenge of finding a way in as a beginner, and what some good things to keep in mind might be when you’re feeling overwhelmed, lost, or out of your depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TLC interviewer:
First of all, before we get too far into this, I just want to know, can I record you?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Okay, great. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student: Yeah, if there’s anything that I’m like off record, I’ll just state it beforehand, but I can’t anticipate anything like that happening. Or I don’t anticipate anything like that happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Totally, totally. Yeah, this shouldn’t be too personal or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
[Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
How are you by the way? Are you okay? You just came out from the protests against the George Floyd murder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. It’s just pretty hot outside. It’s pretty beautiful. Actually, there’s a lot of folks there. There’s some folks handing out like hand sanitizer and water. And making sure everybody’s okay. Which is beautiful. There is a lot more police presence there. I mean, I knew there was going to be but there’s a bit more police presence than I expected right when I was leaving. And the helicopters just came out just a little bit ago. So I still have two friends that are marching. I like just turned off at the street from my house.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
And like people were honking their horns which is just gorgeous. It was great.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
And bus drivers giving everybody thumbs up. Yeah. So yeah, but I’m going to check in on my friends on a little bit to see to see how it ended up progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Good. Good to hear. From what I understand you are very recent student. You haven’t been coming for a very long time. So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally, totally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Can you tell me that story?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Let’s see where I can start. Yeah. Okay, so I saw a posting on Jeff Stark’s email listserv Nonsense for the Mr. Robot Happy Hour. And I was like, “Oh, that looks cool. Sure.” You know, it was like, watch the first episode. I was like, great. And then I got hooked on the TV show and watched all four seasons before the happy hour, which was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Oh, that’s a lot of TV!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, it was a lot of TV. I mean, you know, got some time on my hands right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
I guess there isn’t a better time for it than right now, that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh my god. It was like, kind of surreal though. Um, let’s see and then when I was in the happy hour, I was totally in over my head. Folks were asking questions that I didn’t even understand the question, much less the answer. And it was just this moment of like, what? And then some pieces I could get. And I was like, yeah! But it just kind of left me with this feeling of like, huh, what’s going on? And I actually ended up getting out of the call at about like an hour in and I know that y’all ended up going for probably about three hours with that happy hour, I believe?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, we thought we were gonna actually end at after one hour. And what happened was that it was just so much fun. And people kept having so many good questions, and we kept having so many good conversations with folks. And you know, with the happy hour, as I’m sure you recognized, it was very much sort of all over the place. It wasn’t a curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, totally, free-form.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah. And I had looked at the website a little bit in advance for the curriculum on the Anarcho-Tech website. And on TLC’s website and honestly I was a little like, what am I getting into? What is this thing going to be? What’s it going to look like? Like—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Were you nervous? Were you—was it was an apprehension, what was that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
No, it wasn’t that I was nervous. But like, I, like, when I was looking at the Anarcho-Tech website on the GitHub. I was, it was a little in some ways like, where do I start on this? It was almost like a ball of yarn where I’m like, well, where’s the beginning or the first layer? What? So it was more like that. And then when I was in it, I was definitely like, oh, I’m over my head. Like, is this because I don’t know these things? Or is it? Oh, and I actually have a somewhat odd question for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Oh?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Um, I realized I have no idea what your name even is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, that—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
And I don’t know if that’s intentional or not, but…?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Out of the sort of anarchist principle of collective action, we do not assign names to what we do in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Got it. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
And so that’s why. So it is very intentional thing. That’s why, you know, you’re always going to see me as a TLC instructor and so on and so forth, partly because of the nature of TLC as primarily a school designed to train politically motivated activists in computer network operations that are, of course, extremely potent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally, totally. I had a sneaking suspicion that was it. But then I was like, at first, I was also a little, like, hesitant because I was like, I don’t know who’s behind this and who’s teaching me these things?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Fair!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Or do they know some of these other people I know, and I actually haven’t started checking out like, checking out TLC. Um, in terms of like, vetting through people I also know. It’s a little like, huh, why haven’t I yet? But I feel like I’m getting a lot of the classes. And I feel like your analysis of different things you’ve said, I’m like, Yeah, right on. Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, well, okay. So, let’s talk about that a little bit because obviously, you know, one of the unique things about our work here is that we are in this environment that is incredibly hyper-masculinized and incredibly militarized, and also sort of incredibly geared towards the levers of capitalism, right? It is almost a cliche these days, when you hear people say, “Well, I want to get a good job,” and what they kind of mean is either something in tech or something and like, you know, sort of a white collar field where they’re doing something with technology and data science. This sort of stuff, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
And so it’s been very interesting to try to form for lack of a better way to say it, a marketing position that simultaneously does not feed into the things that we are against politically, but also creates enough of a visible ruckus for the people to notice that we’re here and that we’re actually pretty competent, and that the things that you’ll be learning are the things that you’ll be learning in any other sort of environment where you’re learning these things, with the added benefit of doing so in the ways that we do we—and we can talk a little bit more about that later, the hands on aspect, so the fact that there’s the Socratic method, the fact that there’s, you know, an extreme militant focus on Free Software and sort of immediacy of the benefits of using those technologies, and so on—has been really challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And one of the one of the debates that we’ve been having is, you know, do we go the sort of like, you know, potentially more confrontational route of being more vocal about the ways in which we are trying to make this sort of more not mainstream, but more sort of recognizable by people who are very active political organizers and activists and infrastructural, you know, to supply them with infrastructural capacities, or do we temper that a little bit and sort of speak to the, for lack of a better word, the desperation that the American public is feeling right now about joblessness and economic strife. And of course, obviously, the never ending, you know, attempted slavery of the citizens that is in this country. So, so, or literal slavery is in the past 400 years. So yeah, so that’s been sort the debate. And I’m kind of wondering, that’s a big lead up to this question of, you know, you were saying, who are these people? I don’t know. So like, you know, when you when you found the posting on Nonsense, and then you said you found Anarcho-Tech and you saw the relationship, or at least some relationship between the two groups. It wasn’t off putting you say, but it was a little bit mysterious. So how did that play into your decision to like, then, you know what, I’m gonna see what this is about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Um, let’s see. So I did the Mr. Robot Happy Hour. And then I poked around on the website a little bit more. Ended up signing up for that free overview of the website, because I was like, maybe I don’t know how to like, kind of like grapple in or like, where to start or that beginning of that frayed edge can let me in you know? Which I found that to be incredibly helpful. There’s some information that I felt that I didn’t pick up on on the website, based off of that call, which was super, super helpful, even though then I went back and looked and was like, Oh, the Web site said all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah. That’s okay. That happens as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, and I was not, I was absolutely not turned off by seeing that affiliation between TLC and the other organization that all of a sudden I’m blanking on because my dog is barking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Anarcho-Tech, probably.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
In some ways that like made it more interesting for me because I was like, oh, because I figured the politics would be pretty on point. And the like the idea of like, I mean, I use a computer all the time, you know, but I know that my level of knowledge—like I know a bunch of tech stuff like…. I don’t know, somehow like seeing like the affiliation with the anarchist was like, oh, I bet the security culture is pretty top notch and so like learning cybersecurity from some folks that are into security culture seems like they’d probably be legit. My last professional job was [REDACTED] and the cyber security team there was, is amazing and is more intensive than any other nonprofit I’ve ever worked for. I mean, obviously. But they took, like, security culture to the next level in a way where I was like, oh, whoa, how do I, oh, am I putting myself at risk for this? Or like, what do I not know about? Like, the little pop ups that say accept my cookies? And I’m like, I don’t want to how do I say no? Where is the buttons? Just close the window! You know?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Um, which was one of the things where I kind of wanted to be like, is there like, just an entry level class that y’all offer on like what to do about the cookies?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
You know, ironically, I think there is! There is the “Digital Defenses for the People” workshop, which is a little bit more of like, a sort of a conversation than it is workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, Practical Digital Security, I see it! Got it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
You know, it’s interesting, now I actually have so many questions because the way that you sort of approach this is really, really, really great. Um, so one of the things, you know, we’re not trying to train just anyone in the public, right? That’s why we say if you’re looking for a job, we’re probably not the place for you, like, there are plenty of places you can go get a job certificate, or like an introductory class on this or that. And while we do obviously think that our both material and training is, not to be arrogant about it, but far better than what we’ve seen elsewhere. And I’ll let others be the judge of that of course. The goal is really not to train people who are sort of passively interested, but rather to train people who have a commitment to the sorts of political change that we’d like to see and have an understanding that that will require an infrastructure that doesn’t currently exist and needs to be built, not in the form of new tools, but in the form of an educational sort of milieu that provides the knowledge necessary to gain the skills needed to use the tools that are already available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And that has been an incredibly challenging thing to get across, because and this is sort of where the question comes in, because people who identify themselves as sort of privacy centric or interested in digital security as, you know, as advocates, as opposed to people for whom, you know, primarily they’re interested more on an individual basis, which is, again, not wrong, we welcome them as well. But that’s not really the goal. The real goal is like, you know, to train the people for whom this is going to be part and parcel of a larger motivation, that they’ve been some of the most difficult to get into classes. And so even though we’re parts of groups like the Electronic Frontier Alliance, you know, I don’t a single EFA member has come to our groups. It’s very hard to get EFF members to come to come to workshops free or not. And so, you know, it’s heartening to hear actually, that you come from [REDACTED] you have a background in [REDACTED] organizing, I imagine, because that’s more clearly more or less, you know, that. I wouldn’t say better, but I want to say it’s like, it’s more where we’re trying to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, it’s more in line. Yeah, yeah. So I feel like I do have somewhat of like a theoretical framework, but mostly for TLC, it’s like, purely been curiosity driven. It’s like, I go to one class, and I’m like, Oh, that was cool. Save a bunch of tabs, like, look into some stuff like, Oh, I wanted to do that. And during the process of the class, you usually like reference another class and I’m like, Oh, I should sign up for that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, I mean, that’s the nature of the media, I think is that it’s, A) it’s very easy to sort of interlink things. So one lab goes right up quickly to another, but also I think the actual subject matter is itself extremely intertwined. So you can’t really be good at, like, you know, good in the sense of like, you know, they say you need 10,000 hours to master a skill, right? Well, if you’re, you’re flying, you know, you’re flying an airplane, you need 10,000, you know, hours in front of you in the cockpit, and you’re more or less doing, you know, one balancing act, right? Which is keeping the plane in the air. And with computers, it’s not true at all. Because you are, you absolutely have to do all the things all at once, at the same time. Right, right, in order to be good with the computer, because what the computer is, is really just an extension of the way that it allows you to think and process information and then re-express that information through, you know, other means whether that’s setting up servers or putting you know, lines of code into a project or something and that’s really not something that you can do if you only focus on hyperfocus on one skill area. So it’s a very different game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
It’s totally different. And I do have to say to the other thing for me, that’s really helpful in the way that the classes are framed. It’s not just like, this is how you do it, like click this button, type this and do this. It’s a lot more of like the underpinning of why and how it works, which I think like takes it to the next level, especially for me, where I’m like, oh, I’ve got this and this, and I can kind of connect it to what I learned about this. And then I think, like, it allows me to critically think about processes and systems before being told about it. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Totally. Yeah, actually. And that kind of leads me to that other question that I was wondering about a little earlier. So you have some tech background. But you know, at the same time, you also say that you came to the Mr. Robot thing and some some stuff was like totally over your head. And I think that’s a pretty common experience actually, where people sort of have some exposure to one thing or another. Maybe they’ve even worked in the field. But you know, one thing that we’ve seen over and over again, I’m not sure if this is because again, the approach that we take in the class that you just highlighted, or because of the material being, you know, sort of—what we like to say is that our 101 classes are 201 or 301 classes elsewhere. And that’s not to say that we think that they shouldn’t be 101, like you couldn’t do them. It’s just that when we have 101 level classes, we’re already using the most so-called advanced technologies and tools that you’re going to see in the, you know, in the much more advanced classes. And that’s because there’s no real distinction between the tools you use, you just have to know how to use the tool. It’s like saying, here’s a you know, giving someone a power tool, when you’re teaching them cabinetry making is not wrong. Right, they’re gonna need to know how to use a sander so you don’t not give sanders to beginners, right? They’re gonna use the same tool, you just have to actually train them with that, and we don’t see that happening in other classes. So that’s one of the things that we do. But so like this, this common experience of having sort of maybe initial sense of being overwhelmed and then even though you have some background, how do you, how did you reconcile that with curiosity, you know what, what drove, what made the curiosity win?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, like where did I, like how did I bridge that gap. Because it was overwhelming and I was a little intimidated where I’m like, oh, maybe I’m out of my depth. Maybe this is not the path I should be looking at, even though I’m, I’m curious, maybe I should just like look at some other stuff. And I think I signed up for your email listserv. And I ended up getting the email about the free overview about the website. And I was like, why not? Let me just like, maybe there’s something I’m missing. Maybe there’s like an entry point that’s easier for me. Or maybe they’ll explain to me like, which one is the 101 or where it’s ease, like, Where’s the ideal path in some ways of like a student or learning. So I think that like just jumping from that, like “what?” to a pretty accessible overview of the website, which at first I was like, maybe I shouldn’t even like to take this thing because are they just gonna show me what’s on the website?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Was that not what happened?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
That is what’s happened and there was more than just that, you know, like, I felt like there was a different type of framing. And now I’m trying to think. It was more personalized. So, any questions that any of the other students had were answered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Well, it was real time. That’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
It was real time. Yeah, it was totally real time. And it wasn’t just like an intro to the website, but it was an intro to all of TLC is what it felt like, right? Yeah, kind of gave like an overall arc of like, what the program can do, or like what the organization can do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is that how it happened and then I was like, oh, I’ll just sign up for one class. We’ll see. Because honestly, I am currently unemployed and just got an extended unemployment 13 weeks from the government. So I all of a sudden had a little bit of a pocket of money. And I was like, Oh, I can take one of the classes. I mean, and especially with the tiered model that you have for queer-identified and femme identified folks. I was like, Oh, I can afford to like risk $28 and see if I learn anything. Um, and I felt like I got enough value out of that first class. And that’s when I was like, oh, I’ll sign up for the next thing. And then that’s when the curiosity kind of snowballed. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, it does. Thank you. Very helpful, too. So do you then feel like well, first of all, which was that first class?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
I think the first one I took was the Tor workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
The Tor workshop? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
No, no, I took the BitTorrent. Um, I think Tor browsing is the next one I’m taking. I think?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
I think it’s coming up. So possibly. The BitTorrent workshop also is that, you know, that’s a there’s a funny story behind that one, but I’ll get to that later on. Just that it was never intended to sort of be like, it’s never, it’s not in our curriculum anywhere. But then lockdown happened. And we realized, you know what, actually, this is something people are asking about all the time. We might as well just do one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But yeah, so what was your? So that was the first one you took. You’ve now taken, um….&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
I’ve either I thought I’ve taken like two or three and I’ve got like five, like four or five lined up maybe? Looking at them, I think, yeah, I can’t remember. Let’s see I’ve taken BitTorrent. Um, the virtual machines? I feel like those are the only two I’ve taken so far outside of the Mr. Robot happy hour and the intro. That can’t be right. Can it? I feel like I’ve taken another one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
You were in numerous classes that I remember teaching over the last month and a half. So, maybe were you in the exploiting web applications workshop? Was that one of them?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, yes. I was in that one. I was in that one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
So that’s a good example, right, of a workshop that’s like nowhere near intended for beginners. How did you feel in it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, that one was great. Yeah, I really liked the, the gamification of the fruit stand isn’t that the name of the website?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Juice shop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Juice shop. That’s right. That’s right. Yeah, that made it like, a lot easier. I don’t know. Like, I just really liked it. I think that the second thing you got to the, um, the exploits using the database language, what is that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
SQL?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, SQL. That was when my brain like exploded.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But you didn’t feel like, left behind, like it wasn’t, because you know, that that’s an example of a class that’s really, you know, for us, it’s considered, you know, a sort of a 201 level class. So for most people, you don’t even really get to that until you’re talking about, you know, you’ve taken a networking, you know, curriculum, much less a single course.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like, I kind of expect to go into a class like that, like, almost like, it’s like immersion. Like, when you’re learning a new language, where I feel like I’m going to go into the class, I’m not going to get, I’m not going to understand everything, and that’s okay. That’s not the point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Exactly. That’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
The point is for me to get value out of it, and figure out like how I can, like connect some dots, right? Um, so like, that’s the big thing for me. And then I like, I save all the tabs in Pocket that I opened up during the class and I tag them all with TLC, and then I go back and look at things and, you know, like, sure, there’s a certain amount of self guided learning that can happen as well. So it’s kind of the nice and interesting to feel like I can get my hooks, my claws in, or like my teeth into something. Like there’s more there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
What was your favorite class?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
What’s my favorite class so far? I don’t know. Um, I thought oh, I do have to say I thought that the CMD online modules, especially the mystic one was adorable!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Awesome! That’s the “Enchantment at the Command Line” you’re talking about?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one was adorable. Um, I think that one might be my favorite so far, which that one felt definitely 101 for me because I was expecting more of a like, how do I learn which commands that I need to know most? Um, because like I understand the concept of the terminal. And there’s some, one of the other modules was super helpful too. In terms of a little bit of like theoretical framework of using terminal that I hadn’t really like, put into place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
And these are the free ones that are just on the website, the Foundations courses. Yes?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. Yeah. Um, but I’m still feeling a little like, I’m like, Oh, I still don’t think my terminal skills are that strong. How do I get them stronger? I did find, what’s this one website that’s got some like, wait, let me tell you which one it is. That’s got like some terminal practice. Let’s see. That I now have some time set aside to do. Let’s see, let’s see. Well, there’s Hack the Box EU but that’s not the one for this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, there’s quite a number. We used to recommend Code Academy before they started charging for their beginner courses. There’s another one called Taming the Terminal that I know about. That is really good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh I think that might be it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, Taming the Terminal is fantastic. And it’s a, it’s an article and podcast series. So we recommend that and have been recommending that for a long time. And you know, it’s interesting because we didn’t have any of the original, you know, beginning foundation courses on our website, because we simply linked out to Taming the Terminal. But it didn’t, you know, it, maybe that same thing happened where you’re like, you know, am I gonna go to this thing, and people are just gonna tell me how to read the website. I know how to read a website, but actually it was really helpful. You know, I mean, like, maybe that’s where the same thing happen. People don’t always you know, there’s a lot to read and if that’s not the style in which people are used to learning or if that’s not as you know, their learning style doesn’t sort of meld well with having to read a lot, then it’s really nice to be able to just sort of do something right then in there by loading a container in your browser, like the Foundations courses allow you to do or coming to a workshop and seeing in real time, something like this. So yeah, that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you feel like they prepared you well enough for the courses, that when you were going through the foundation series? Were they, you know, were they enough to give you a sense of when I open a terminal in a class, you’re not lost?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, I can follow along in a terminal. Like, it’s like one of those things like a language, right, like I can, I can read it and hear it and understand it, but I can’t write it just yet. Right. And so it did feel like there was a, let me try. I’ll think on this a little bit more. It did seem like there is maybe like, one, one more module that I would have loved to take before some of the classes, but maybe it’s actually part of the the modules that I haven’t taken yet that are on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Hmm. There are also some more being planned to be put out there. So if we have another 15 or so that is not quite yet ready for being published, but will eventually be published. So it’s possible that it’s just not complete, so maybe you’re not missing anything. It’s really just not there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Not there, yeah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Okay, what about your expectations before you came? Like, have you taken classes akin to this or sort of adjacent to this sort of topic before? Is this a completely new experience? You talked about the cyber security team at [REDACTED], were they giving you any kind of corporate training that was sort of reminiscent or at least sort of in the same ballpark as this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Let’s see. At [REDACTED] I did get some security training, but it was specific to the project that I was working on. So it was very grounded in next steps, if you will, it wasn’t very conceptual at all. It was like should we put superglue in this USB port? Should we…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right, tool and tactic focused.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah, it was very tactic focus of like, how do we wipe the phones? How do we check for malware? How do we do this? We had some like as needed kind of training. Some of it I kinda already knew like, in some cases, I would just look things up online and be like, hey, Reddit, what’s up? Let me find out this. And did end up finding some pretty fun workarounds in order to get what I wanted done. And then once I like, knew how to do that, then I played around with a little bit to be like, what else can I make it do? So like, there’s a couple things like that, where it’s like, self guided in some ways, then, definitely having some expertise of like, I am sure that you’ve picked up on the fact that I am definitely a person that doesn’t shy away from asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, that’s great. That makes, for what it’s worth, right? The, in the classes, when they are in real time: that makes the class! You know, that’s what makes the class good! If no one’s asking questions, it’s just a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
And it’s boring. Well, not that boring. It’s just like how does that apply to this other thing I was thinking about. One thing that I’m really into the classes with other students is that sometimes other people in the class ask questions that I don’t even know to ask. Yes. And that’s the thing that I’m like whoa, wait, what do you mean? What? What’s Vagrant? What do you mean, wait, I got to Google this while you’re still talking. Oh shit, I missed what you just said because I was googling this other thing I’ve never heard of or, [laughs].&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
There is a, for what it’s worth, there is a Vagrant, not specific class but a Vagrant, there is a workshop in which Vagrant is a central piece specifically and that’s called Automate all the Things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, I feel like I’m not ready for Automate all the Things because I can’t do the things that I want to be automated yet. So I’m like holding off on that for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah that makes sense, that’s fine. But when you get there, it’s you know part of it. And also, of course, the labs themselves. The actual practice labs, you can download and run on your own, is there, they’re all automated with Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, cool. Oh, that’s nice. Nice. Yeah, I haven’t gotten to the level to run any of the labs yet. So that’s one of my things I, yeah. And you asked if I’d taken any other classes in this format. Um, I’ve taken some on-demand learning in other areas. I really find that live teachers work better for me than, like, pre-recorded videos. And honestly, just to get me in front of the computer and do it in most cases, it just like, creates that sense of like time boundedness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, I’ve had a very hard time learning from, uh, recorded classes as well, when I was, you know, I, I was unfortunate in that I did not actually have a live teacher at all. But the result of that was, was that it just had to, that it took me a lot longer to get to the point where I’m seeing TLC students now get to. And that makes sense. You know, the live instruction, there’s something about humans. Human mimicry, I think is a huge part of human learning. And you don’t get that if you are mimicking the recording, because what you’re missing is, as you said that you’re getting very sort of tools and tactics focus, but if you don’t find yourself in a situation where that exact tactic or that exact tool is available to you, you’re sort of out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, totally. I did shoot over an email to a few of my friends that I thought might be interested in TLC. Um, and I found and I mentioned to them in the email, no matter what the time is that set up for the class I always add an extra hour on and expect the class to go for an additional hour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
[Laughs.] Yeah, that, I admit. So that is not every class happens that way. But I am—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, so far, it’s been consistently every class!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Okay, well, what I want to say is every class that I teach tends to do that because I have this, I just, I remember, you know, the sort of after the official close of things being always the best time for me. Yeah, I’m one of those people who’s like, always wanted to hang out later. Like, let’s go to a cafe at the coffee shop afterwards and hang out and talking. That’s, that’s when the real good stuff, so for me that’s just like, I just like don’t care about the end time. I’m just like, let’s just keep going, you know, and yeah, but I don’t—that is not a universal policy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, that’s funny. That’s but yeah, like the first time I was like a little antsy. And then I was like, what’s going on, but I want to stick around because it’s still good. And it’s so interesting. And then then every time after that, I’m like, I’m just expecting that. And then I’m like, Oh, yeah, that’s great if it ends earlier than that, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah. Yeah, that’s…that’s my style. But so on that note, like, the thing that I’m curious about given your particular, again, you have some a little bit of corporate training experience, I think a lot of people have this corporate training experience had have this sort of scenario where they feel like they are getting a—like they’re looking through a pinhole, I think is how a lot of people might feel about it. I know that when I talk to some folks, and they talk about even being in the cybersecurity field, but trained at a job, you get this very, very narrow view of what is useful for the job, and what is useful for that specific role of that specific company.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So for example, I’ve heard from digital security trainers who have told me that they don’t feel like they really understand how to answer questions because they can only answer questions about, like, the one tool they’re trained to answer questions on. Right. And, and to me, that speaks to a failure from an education standpoint, because they’re not being trained, trained in security principles. They’re being trained in security practices. But the practices flow from the principles. You can’t actually generalize a tactic if you don’t understand why that tactic is effective in the environment you’re in. And so they find themselves sort of, not gonna say names, of course, but like, there’s some people who’ve been in some very prestigious roles in some of these national online privacy and security training organizations that have told us at TLC, told me personally, actually, that, you know, they feel like they sort of, that they’re in an environment where because they’re trainers rather than developers or, you know, the actual IT team or the actual security team at that place, that they’re not getting training in the ways that the cybersecurity team is at the IT team is, you know, and that’s really striking to me when when you’re when you’re talking about sort of national organizations whose supposed job is to train others right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How, I don’t understand how those trainers aren’t prioritized in those organizations. I think that tends to do a disservice to groups who were paying much more than they would pay in a workshop at TLC as an example, to have a private corporate training on these things. And so that leads me to my question, which is, when you compare your experiences, either in that environment or when you just sort of your actual experiences at TLC with the expectations that you had before you arrived at classes, how do you feel about them? Do they meet? Do they just is it just a completely different worlds like apples and oranges, obviously, the goals of  different training groups are different. And I think even you know, TLC makes a very big point about saying that you know, you’re not going to get the same kind of training with us as you would with you know, General Assembly or Flatiron School and so on, because we clearly have very different end goals. But, for your goals. Do you know, given whatever it is that you want it to do, whether it be just curiosity or you know your own purposes. Did you find that? Or have you been finding that the the workshops that you’ve been attending maps to expectations you have? Has it been completely different? What was the outcome of that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Well, I feel like I don’t go into TLC with many expectations is first of what’s going on. I feel like if I went to any of the General Assembly classes, I would have much higher expectations or different expectations, partially because of the price tag. And yeah, I mean, really. And partially because it seems more…how do I say this? Like when I’m thinking about like, the information that TLC is providing, as opposed to General Assembly or like, say like, trainers within certain companies It feels like those are focused on like, this is what you need either for a job or the capitalist system, or for the end goal of the organization itself. And it’s not as focused on like, what do you want to learn? What’s helpful? Here’s all the information in some ways. I feel like there’s something else I was gonna say about that. But I just lost my train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Um, well, so the price point is an interesting piece of it too, because that has been, you know, so this is maybe not history you’re aware of. But for three years, TLC was entirely free. There was no classes that cost anything. There were no workshops we were doing sort of workshops on, we were a little smaller, in that we didn’t have an online presence. And so it was a little bit harder for certain people to find us. Of course, if you weren’t in New York City, that meant you couldn’t come to a workshop because they were in person, but they were all free. And then we decided in 2019 to stop doing that. And the reason weirdly, was because we got more attendance when we charge people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Oh, because then people are more invested in showing up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Not only that—yeah, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Similar to free events versus like paid events, in some cases like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right, yeah. But also, we found that, and I want to be careful here because I don’t want to put down the folks who are doing free digital security events, because I think that that’s great that they’re doing that, but we’re not doing what they are doing. It’s very clear to someone who has come to a workshop that what we are doing is on a level far beyond, both technically and in terms of ambition, what you’ll probably see at a library where you’re going to like, here’s how to like, you know, wipe the browser history in your phone or your tablet. Like it’s, which is why I don’t want to put them down because we’re not you know…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
I mean, people have to enter in at different places like we don’t all start at the same place. And that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, the challenge though, because when we were doing free events was that people thought it was the same.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Ohhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
So what happened was, we were unable to, sort of, because TLC didn’t even start in the same way that these other sort of sort of advocacy, grassroots community group things started, you know, we have a very different history as well. But what happened was because it didn’t appear to be different from the outside, if you didn’t know any better, and you didn’t have any experience already, then you looked at, you know, the 10 or 20 different, you know, groups in New York doing, you know, some kind of digital privacy, whether it be sort of a downtown meetup or whether it be, you know, a different EFA, Electronic Frontier Alliance member, or just sort of like, you know, the, you know, the city’s own, you know, here’s how to do “see something, say something” on the Internet kind of thing, right? Like, you couldn’t really tell the difference. Because nothing, none of it cost money. You could go to, you know, NYPL and go to a privacy workshop and you’d think it was the same thing as you hop into a TLC class where, you know, even though our descriptions are things like, you know, launch your own phishing attack, like, you know, the MTA is not gonna not gonna host that, you know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But you don’t know what that means. And so it’s hard to—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally, and in some ways, when I looked at some of the workshop descriptions, some of them I was a little like, what? I don’t even know what that means, like, what would I learn what is happening here?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
But I do have to say one of the things that I tried to sign up for some boot camp or like, there’s some sort of like, hacking 101 through Full Stack Academy, I think, that I was gonna take and it was just boring.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
How was it so boring?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
I don’t know. Because this is exciting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah. And so like something about like, the way that the TLC is approached either in terms of like, what can you use this for? What can this go? It’s just, it’s more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, cool. Hm. I know that a lot of people come to TLC from, well, I’ll give this example of someone who actually came to that, a phishing workshop. And they were a cybersecurity engineer at a law firm. And they left in what I can only describe as awe that they didn’t learn what they learned at the workshop at the job. And so I’m kind of wondering from that, because this is also a thing that we consistently see happening, where people come in with an expectation of what they might learn that is far very different from what actually happens. And I kind of want to tease out whether that’s because of the material or because of the approach or because of a combination of it. I think a lot of people are, y’know, because we have these two conflicting things happening. On the one hand people come to a webinar and expect to sort of get their hands on a keyboard and sort of go through a sort of series of steps on their own, because they’ve seen that happen, right? That’s how a lot of teaching happens—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Well I think it’s about teaching pedagogy, right? Well, I’m hearing two different things. I think it’s a little bit about teaching pedagogy as well as marketing and communications of what the workshops and events currently say on the Web site. It feels like someone who is an expert in cybersecurity wrote the workshop synopses, which is perfect and great, but for someone who is an outsider it’s sometimes, like I don’t really know what’s gonna happen. And then after I take the class I go back and read it and I’m like, yeah, that’s exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
[Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
[Laughs.] Again, it’s like that thing of like, a beginner mindset of just even for marketing. And yeah, in some ways, for me personally, like paired with my curiosity, I’m like I don’t really know what’s going to happen and, gah, I’m gonna learn something! It’s helpful for me, but there’s definitely a few of the classes, oh I signed up for the shell class, the Writing with Blue Fire, where I read it and I was like I’m definitely going to be in over my head. Like, I probably shouldn’t have signed up for that class, based off of the synopsis, but I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Hm, have you had that experience with other workshops, where you were like, I shouldn’t do this, but then you did and it was okay, or it was exactly what you thought and it was too much, or…?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Mmmm. Let’s see. Well, I didn’t sign up for the Automate all the Things because I was like, that’s going to be over my head, um. I wanted to sign up for the crypto, the Bare Bones Crypto, but I was like, I don’t think I can do that one. I think it’s more like I haven’t taken some classes because I’m assuming it’s over my head based off of the write up or the synopsis. I know that some of the classes have that matrix that say beginner versus not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah. The persona training matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some of them, which I think is a little bit of why I wanted to take that how to understand the Web site, where I was like, what’s beginner, what’s 101, what’s 507, like, where? Where do I get there?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, that’s kind of another challenge, is that we don’t really have a curriculum that differentiates between what people would call beginner or advanced because we start with the things that people don’t show you until they’ve already bluntly brainwashed you to believing that a certain way of things has to be the way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
That makes it difficult to…because, part of it is that, y’know, it’s not that there’s no progression. There’s obviously a progression, but the frustration from the teaching team, for us is that it’s, there’s a prescribed way to go about teaching this from the perspective of interest in jobs and the sort of cooperation with capitalism that does not serve the goals of an individual or a non-cooperative, capitalistically noncooperative organization such as an advocacy group whose entire purpose is to upend that system. And what we found is that part of the, and I’m speaking from personal experience here, I happen to be one of the more I’ll say experienced from the professional side of things folks in the group just because I, y’know, I’m unemployed now but I’ve had an almost 15 year career in tech and I hated it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
[Laughs.] Aw.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
I did, I absolutely hated it. I learned a lot, but I hated it. And I certainly didn’t learn comfortably. That was, uh, that was a very painful…. One of the reasons I’m involved in TLC is because I personally don’t think that you should have to struggle in anguish to learn stuff. That doesn’t make sense. As a learning methodology, that seems stupid. Learning should be easy because it’s something humans do very naturally, it’s something we were made to do, in a way, and it’s something that we can do if we’re given any kind of sensible guidance that isn’t designed to restrict us. And that’s exactly the opposite of my experience in the tech industry, and that’s what I keep hearing over and over and over again where they’re like, I’m looking through this pinhole and I don’t really understand why that group is doing that over there, or how this technology relates to what we’re doing over here, because I’m never told and I’m never shown, and I’m never given an opportunity to try it out. But anyway, sorry, that was a little bit of a vent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
[Laughs.]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But my point is that as a result, when you come to a beginning networking class for TLC, y’know, you’re shown Wireshark. But that’s a tool that security analysts use day in and day out. That is a military tool. You’re shown that as one of the first things we open in a networking class is already at the level of the stuff that you will see at a SOC, at a Security Operations Center, on every screen from every analyst that’s there. And there’s no middle ground. Because there doesn’t have to be because it’s the same tool. You can do that stuff in, you could teach that stuff with the complex tools, in the same way that I wouldn’t expect someone to go to a graphic design class and never be shown Photoshop until they’re into their fourth year. That’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But that’s exactly what happens with security and of course it’s because in Photoshop you don’t have the capability of actually, immediately, for example carving out files from an exfiltration. I mean, it’s a very militarized capability. Right? It’s a weaponized thing. So there’s a culture around the teaching of it that is itself very, very skewed. And so it’s difficult—at the same time of trying to say that, well we don’t want to say then that Wireshark is an advanced tool, because that doesn’t make any sense, actually. At the same time we don’t want to give the impression that if you have never had any background in this that you’re supposed to understand the plethora of menus and buttons and stuff. Like, that’s not the goal either. But you seem to have this understanding intuitively, where you come in and say I’m not going to understanding everything but I’m not supposed to. And I think some people do think that they have to come in and leave having that, and finding that balance has been really tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Well I think that’s it, um, mmm, like the wrong assumption to go into any class and be an expert after an hour. Like it’s kind of like, so it’s like, or also like if you think about it as an analogy of a muscle, if I’m learning to use a new muscle or I’m learning a new, like, I don’t know, dance move, I’m not going to be perfect at it, at the choreography after only like a 15 minute lesson because I’ve never even learned how to do any of the, I’ve never tap danced before or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
But at the end of those 15 minutes, right, like, hopefully if you have a good teacher, you should I hope, feel like, y’know, maybe I could do this or I feel like I’m sort of getting it or I see the outlines, or I understand where we’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Has that felt true to you?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, that’s totally felt true to me and I think to follow that analogy of like choreography and like a 15 minute lesson or whatever also after 15 minutes you kind of have a general idea of what the steps are even if you can’t memorize and remember them all, and that you’re enjoying it. Like I think that enjoyment is, like, key to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Right. And so have the workshops that you’ve been in at least met that bar? I mean, enough to at least continue to pay to come.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally! Totally. Yeah. And I do have to say that like, your following, what you call it, going down a rabbit hole of, like, a rant about something political, I’m like, what! [Laughs.] Yeah, that’s been, uh, enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
[Laughs.] Well I’m glad that that’s—I’ve been loosening my tongue a little bit, I gotta say, just because it’s hard not to in this climate, but um, I’m glad that that has been fun as opposed to, again, confrontational or off-putting. It’s definitely—&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
No, no, no. In some ways, those give a hint of what you can use this information for, right? Like, when you’re talking about, um, when you’re like, “Y’know, do whatever you want, but practice with the legal stuff.” That, like, it’s real, and then just like the hints at, like, oh maybe you want to look at see what happened with DNC, that would be, y’know, um, hints at things that make it, like, very real, but not in that prescriptive way of like, if you do this then you can learn to do this robot face. Y’know, like, it’s, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Yeah, that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, totally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Well, hey, we’re at an hour and I want to keep my promise of not keeping you for longer than an hour no matter what so, um, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me about this and for answering my questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah, yeah, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Sweet, thank you again, this was super fun. I really appreciate your time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Totally, same, same, same. Thanks so much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Interviewer:
Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Student:
Yeah. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

By interviewing newer repeat students, we've been able to improve our Web site, workshop descriptions, and even come up with new events. But these interviews also offer current or prospective students an illuminating look at Tech Learning Collective itself, our history, our motivations, and what makes us different from other tech schools or other digital education initiatives. Published with our students' permission, the Tech Learning Collective Student Profile Series is a set of audio recordings curated from these interviews that we'll release over time, beginning today.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-student-profile-series.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-student-profile-series.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Protecting protester privacy, beyond the listicles.</title><link href="http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/03/protecting-protester-privacy-beyond-the-listicles.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Protecting protester privacy, beyond the listicles." /><published>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/03/protecting-protester-privacy-beyond-the-listicles</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://techlearningcollective.com/2020/06/03/protecting-protester-privacy-beyond-the-listicles.html">&lt;p&gt;We at Tech Learning Collective stand with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blacklivesmatter.com/&quot;&gt;Movement for Black Lives&lt;/a&gt;. We stand with all those who are calling for immediate financial divestment from police departments nationwide and the reallocation of police department budgets towards investments in community housing, education, public health, and other social services. We applaud the small number of police officers so far who have laid down their batons and guns instead of using them on peaceful protesters and we insist that, next, they lay down their badges as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of centuries, all the various governmental bodies of the United States have routinely, repeatedly, and clearly shown their callous disregard for Black life. They have eagerly used many different weapons to kill, marginalize, and terrorize people of color, particularly Black people. A homicidal cop’s knee pressed on George Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis is simply one recent example of this barbaric and genocidal history. The badge-wearing murderers who invaded the Louisville home and took the life of Breonna Taylor is another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This racist behavior, and all of the oppressions that enable, support, or excuse it, must end &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, because Black lives matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As people all over the country and the world are moved to dismantle white supremacy where we live and work, some are compelled to march in the streets. Others speak up and out online. Regardless of how you choose to help put an end to the injustices you’re seeing and experiencing, our goal at Tech Learning Collective is to empower you to safely take the actions you feel are appropriate by ensuring you have the knowledge and skills needed to fully harness the awesomely potent power of the digital devices you already use every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That computer you’re using to read this very message is arguably among your most powerful assets because it can be both your pen and your sword at the same time—if you know how to use it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be hearing about tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;Signal Private Messenger&lt;/a&gt; that can help keep your text messages private and out of the hands of the surveillance State. Maybe you’re once again reading warnings to “use a VPN” scrolling down your Twitter feed. We’ve certainly noticed a new wave of listicles full of advice for how to stay safe while you protest showing up on popular online media outlets (yet again). What we’re not seeing, though, is the same thing that was missing the last time headlines like these exploded onto the front pages of mainstream newspapers: what do we do &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; we read the listicle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built Tech Learning Collective for a scenario very much like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Tech Learning Collective were brought together even before the 2016 US presidential election by a shared overarching goal of training communities in how to liberate themselves from corporate and government overseers, especially as it relates to owning and operating their own information and communications infrastructures. We view this form of education and training as a necessary prerequisite for sustained and meaningful revolutionary action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back on May 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, we scheduled &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2020/07/workshop-2020-07-03-signal-and-surveillance-how-to-exercise-digital-civil-liberties-in-a-surveillance-state&quot;&gt;our next “Signal and Surveillance: How to Exercise Digital Civil Liberties in a Surveillance State” online workshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is a deep dive into effective Signal use, covering much more than simply how to install it. In the workshop, we explain what Safety Numbers are and why they are so important, how to do trusted third-party Safety Number verifications, minimize on-device data retention through disappearing messages and conversation trimming, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This communications safety tool is absolutely vital for the general public to use &lt;em&gt;and understand&lt;/em&gt;, especially now. Just today, the Drug Enforcement Administration, a federal law enforcement agency supposedly limited by statute to drug-related crimes, was shown to have requested and been granted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/george-floyd-police-brutality-protests-government&quot;&gt;sweeping authority to conduct covert surveillance on anti-racist protesters&lt;/a&gt;. This shows us, yet again, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/the-surveillance-of-blackness-from-the-slave-trade-to-the-police/&quot;&gt;government surveillance is disproportionately aimed at Black people ever since the days of Lantern Laws&lt;/a&gt; in the 1700’s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/topics/cointelpro&quot;&gt;through the Civil Rights era with COINTELPRO&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/03/19/black-lives-matter-fbi-surveillance/&quot;&gt;continuing today by tracking BLM organizers after the Ferguson uprising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further support protesters in this moment and fight back against the swell of neofascist activity on the part of government agencies, we are adding another, even lower price tier for attendance to our next “Signal and Surveillance” webinar workshop. The new $10 tier (a $13 total out-of-pocket cost) is a 50% reduction from the previously lowest, already “reduced” price tier. We continue to explore ways to increase access to world-class cybersecurity education and this latest price reduction is intended for BLM organizers and activists, protesters, and supporters of calls for police and prison abolition. Tickets for the workshop at this tier are available only through the following link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techlearningcollective.com/r/workshop-2020-07-03&quot;&gt;https://techlearningcollective.com/r/workshop-2020-07-03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our normal webinar price tiers ($25 tier for queer-identified and femme people, $35 tier for general admission, and $70 tier for those who can afford to help fund the digital security and online privacy advocacy communities with their financial resources) are still available via the Web site and we encourage you to choose the tier that is most appropriate for you. But in this pivotal moment, we hope more people will accept our invitation to attend this workshop at the lower price tier because we believe more widespread digital security training will be vital to the success of social justice movements whose opponents control much of the commercial Internet and racist government institutions. Please also extend this offer to a friend participating in the protests against police brutality, especially if you yourself cannot attend our webinar workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we are of course continuing to host other workshops that are relevant for protecting your privacy and helping you improve your online safety all through the month of June and into July, as we have been doing all year long. Our &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2020/06/workshop-2020-06-14-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything&quot;&gt;workshop on anonymous Web browsing and publishing using the Tor Browser, for example, will be held on June 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2020/06/workshop-2020-06-07-gone-phishing-how-to-recognize-fake-websites-and-other-online-scams&quot;&gt;on June 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, we are re-running our combination attack/defense workshop on recognizing phishing scams&lt;/a&gt; that are often used to hijack social media accounts and steal passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed in ending racism and abolishing the abusive institutions enshrined in the American system of government and so-called “criminal justice,” we’re going to need a sustained, strategic, multi-racial coalition committed to many different kinds of work. People with white privilege must be willing to listen to, understand, and take direction from Black, brown, and indigenous people. This coalition will need to use a diversity of tactics and will need to welcome constructive participation in many different ways from many different people so that we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; remain united &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200509023739/http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html&quot;&gt;in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements&lt;/a&gt;. Tech Learning Collective believes we can do this most effectively by taking our cues from the formative radical groups who came before us such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combahee_River_Collective&quot;&gt;Combahee River Collective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that a big part of all of these efforts will take place online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We refuse to sit back and rely on the very same corporations and government institutions who have consistently failed to act ethically or in good faith for centuries to provide us with the communications channels, organizing platforms, education, and privacy-protecting tools we need to navigate the challenges ahead of us. Also today, reports revealed the CEO of the popular video conferencing tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users&quot;&gt;Zoom stated their intent to deny its free tier users protection through encryption for the explicit purpose of handing over user calls to the FBI&lt;/a&gt; so that they can continue to monitor and undermine protest organizers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/10/29/fbi-surveillance-black-activists/&quot;&gt;they have been doing shamelessly for decades&lt;/a&gt;. “Free users — for sure we don’t want to give [them] that, because we also want to work together with the FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose,” Zoom’s CEO said on an investor call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time for community-owned, self-hosted, autonomous digital infrastructures and the knowledge to operate them ourselves is now. To get there, we need more people who recognize the ethics they embed into the code they write and the political relevance of the skills they’re learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let that be you. Please join us for our upcoming workshops, or help those who are looking for radical technical training find us by sharing this offer with those you believe would benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">We at Tech Learning Collective stand with the Movement for Black Lives.

It meant that Tech Learning Collective had produced enough events—twelve, by EFA organizer’s count—in a mere four months to earn our place as the group with the second highest number of events recognized by the EFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fellow New Yorkers, the CyPurr Collective, who have been EFA members for numerous years, narrowly beat us out by one EFA-recognized event. Their total was 13 events, spread across the full twelve months. We would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the CyPurr Collective on their 2019 Activity Challenge victory! We’re very proud to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance/allies#region-eastern&quot;&gt;represent our hometown of New York City in the top two slots for this challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, as part of a follow up to the EFA 2019 Activity Challenge, Tech Learning Collective was excited to be interviewed by EFF EFA organizers for a feature profile that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/tech-learning-collective-grassroots-technology-school-case-study&quot;&gt;now published on the EFF Deeplinks blog&lt;/a&gt; in an abridged version edited for length. The profile is part of their blog series highlighting grassroots groups educating communities about digital safety and online privacy. The series has already featured CyPurr Collective and CryptoParty Ann Arbor, who were both in attendance at &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/11/01/press-release-hackers-next-door-2019.html&quot;&gt;our recent Hackers Next Door 2019 conference&lt;/a&gt; at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full interview was conducted over email in early May 2020 but was shortened for publication on the EFF Deeplinks blog, so we have reprinted it in full here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-have-any-requests-for-your-introductory-section&quot;&gt;Do you have any requests for your introductory section?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here is the current boilerplate text about Tech Learning Collective that we ask other groups to use when writing about us. Feel free to trim this down if needed:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school for radical organizers headquartered in New York City that provides a security-first IT infrastructure curriculum to otherwise underserved communities and organizations advancing social justice causes. We train politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia, Information Technology, and radical political practice.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Founded and operated exclusively by radical queer and femme technologists, we offer unparalleled free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our students are primarily people of marginalized groups and other individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote memorization exercises for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-inspired-you-all-to-start-the-tech-learning-collective-how-has-the-group-changed-over-time&quot;&gt;What inspired you all to start the Tech Learning Collective? How has the group changed over time?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2016, a group of anarchist and autonomist radicals met in Brooklyn, NY to seek out methods of mutual self-education around technology. Many of us did not have backgrounds in computer technology. What we did have was background in justice movement organizing at one point or another, whether at the WTO protests before the turn of the century, supporting whistleblowers such as Chelsea Manning, participating in Occupy Wall Street, or in various other campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This first version of Tech Learning Collective met regularly for about a year as a semi-private mutual-education project. It succeeded in sewing the seeds of what would later become several additional justice-oriented technology groups. None of the members were formally trained technologists. None of us have ever held computer science degrees. Many of the traditional techniques of and environments offering technology education felt alienating to us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, everyone involved recognized the transformative and astonishingly powerful capacities that modern digital technologies could have in the hands of people whose focus is ethics and justice rather than profit—exactly the opposite ethos as that enacted by Silicon Valley, despite their claims to “make the world a better place.” So, after a (surprisingly short!) period of mutual self-education, we began offering free workshops and classes on computer technologies specifically for Left-leaning politically engaged individuals and groups. Our goal was to advocate for more effective use of these technologies in our movement organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We quickly learned that courses needed to cater to people with skill levels ranging from self-identified “beginners” to very experienced technologists, and that our efforts needed to be self-sustaining. Partly, this was because many of our comrades had sworn off technical self-sufficiency as a legitimate avenue for liberation in a misguided but understandable reaction to the poisonous prevalence of machismo, knowledge grandstanding, and blatant sociopathy they saw exhibited by the overwhelming majority of “techies.” It was obvious that our trainers needed to exemplify a totally new culture to show them that cyber power, not just computer literacy, was a capability worth investing their time in for the sake of The Movement™.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Following the 2016 US Presidential election, Tech Learning Collective members dispersed into a number of urgent community projects, but the need to offer high quality technology education to groups and individuals engaged in radical, grassroots, and non-profit work remained. Then in early 2019, and now engaged in numerous different new groups, several of us worked to loosely codify a curriculum development and student mentoring process that we had experienced ourselves be dramatically more effective at “upskilling” interested students than those provided by code bootcamps, digital vocational training, and other employment-centric initiatives. This lived experience of contrasting the different pedagogies convinced us to form what is now Tech Learning Collective’s free, by-donation, and low-cost educational efforts in our existing formats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, Tech Learning Collective continues offering exceptional Information Technology (IT) educational opportunities at a much lower cost than traditional computer courses (free, in some cases!) and provides supplementary funding for the existent activist projects that grew out of the first version of Tech Learning Collective meetings in the mid 2010’s. In keeping with our original mission, Tech Learning Collective is especially in service to people who might identify themselves as being “outsiders” to the mainstream “tech world.” That is, we are primarily invested in those folks who have either never been tech workers or who have otherwise felt at odds with the general culture of technocapitalism, its tech bros, and its monocultural intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s singular overarching goal is to provide its students with the knowledge and abilities to liberate their communities from corporate and government overseers, especially as it relates to owning and operating their own information and communications infrastructures, which we view as a necessary prerequisite for meaningful revolutionary actions. Using these skills, our students assist in the organization of activist work like abortion access and reproductive rights, anti-surveillance organizing, and other efforts that help build collective power beyond mere (“voter”) representation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn’t changed over the years is that, at Tech Learning Collective, students learn how to extend and enhance the existing capabilities of their projects and communities using free, open, and increasingly ubiquitous digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-your-target-audience&quot;&gt;Who is your target audience?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who is serious about gaining the skills, knowledge, and power they need to materially improve the lives of their community, neighbors, and friends and who also shares our pro-social values is welcome at our workshops and events. This means we take political stances including anti-capitalism, feminism, queer rights, trans liberation, anti-racism, animal liberation, environmental justice, and other social justice causes extremely seriously. Tech Learning Collective instructors make a point to embed these values in all of our workshops (“it’s a machine-in-the-middle, not necessarily man-in-the-middle”), and all of our workshop materials use examples relevant to political organizing scenarios as the basis for practice labs and other exercises (“if ‘you are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor,’ how will you communicate safely such that the Empire does not catch you?”).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Another way to say this is that we are uninterested in teaching people who have a lot of access to other, more mainstream technology education. If you often enjoy your downtown IT or tech Meetup group, you probably won’t find Tech Learning Collective classes comfortable. Although thankfully rare, we have occasionally had to ban some people (mostly men) for taking up too much space in classrooms, or people who seem more interested in learning just enough basic tech to begin a startup regardless of their self-identification. We are not shy about doing this because we are a grassroots political group first and a technology school second, not the other way around like basically all other professional-level tech training options out there right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are dozens upon dozens of places you can go to learn how to memorize the answers to interview questions, get a tech certification, or pigeonhole yourself into a career path. Folks interested in that kind of activity just don’t last very long as Tech Learning Collective apprentices or students because we’re not putting down what they want to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-some-steps-you-take-to-ensure-your-work-is-accessible-to-people-without-a-background-in-tech&quot;&gt;What are some steps you take to ensure your work is accessible to people without a background in tech?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Making our workshops and other events accessible to people without a background in tech is actually really easy for us because both our materials and our methodology actually begins at the beginning. We know that’s something a lot of people say they’re doing but, to be blunt, we simply don’t see it happening a lot outside of Tech Learning Collective classes and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We know what it’s like to wade into the world of digital security as a novice because we’ve all done it at one point or another. Some of us did it as recently as a year or so ago. We felt confounded or overwhelmed by the vast amount of information suddenly thrown at us. Worse, much of this information purported to be “for beginners,” making us feel even worse about our apparent inability to understand it. ‘Are we just stupid?’, we often asked ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;No. The reality is that these self-proclaimed “beginner” resources are either wildly self-referential, full of assumptions of prior knowledge, or just simply bad explanations that are incoherent at best. Often, the security resources you’ll find when you do an Internet search are all three of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You are not stupid. Digital security is genuinely hard. Look, most people just don’t teach cybersecurity well, if they even bother to focus on teaching in the first place. We insist that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; understand this stuff. It’s just that, most of the time, you’re being shown a scattershot, piecemeal presentation coming through a human filter who, often, isn’t deeply familiar with the material in the first place. Given that, is it any wonder this stuff seems damn near impossible to learn?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The real reason it often feels like you’re having a hard time understanding what the teachers at a cybersecurity class are trying to show you is that they don’t know how to explain what they’re doing. In fact, most of the time, they don’t even &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; you anything at all, preferring instead to discuss how something &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; work in some hypothetical scenario  rather than showing you, right then and there on their computer screen, how it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works in real life today. Very often, these classes and events offer nothing more than slideshows containing oversimplified diagrams after a rundown asserting that the teacher holds some credentials, even though none of those credentials are “Masters of Education.” Too often, they never even actually show the technology being discussed, which we think is just absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Tech Learning Collective classes are dramatically more interactive, which makes them far more digestible and approachable for actual beginners as well as experienced technologists both. Our methodology focuses almost exclusively on providing guided, kinetic, experience-based training in fully-fledged, real-life scenarios using physical hardware, cloud environments, or both. There are never slideshows, which means it feels less like a business meeting and more like watching an episode of Mr. Robot with the director’s commentary on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Best of all, our pedagogy is intentionally Socratic, which means our teachers repeatedly engage students with questions and challenges in real-time. We do this because we know you can watch a slideshow, read the manual, or run through the practice lab on your own time. It’s very obvious that the best use of our time together is to do what humans do best; converse, question, and mimic one another. This means everyone always gets a lot out of class time precisely because it avoids the all-too-common situation where one person runs into an error and everyone else has to wait for the troubleshooting to end before the class can resume.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We regularly receive feedback from students who have little to no background as technologists expressing surprise that they learned as much as they did as quickly as they did. But don’t take our word for it: have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://techlearningcollective.com/testimonials/&quot;&gt;our Testimonials page&lt;/a&gt; to see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;last-winter-you-hosted-the-hackers-next-door-conference-in-nyc-could-you-tell-us-about-how-you-approached-such-an-ambitious-and-collaborative-project-were-there-any-surprises-along-the-way&quot;&gt;Last Winter you hosted the Hackers Next Door conference in NYC, could you tell us about how you approached such an ambitious and collaborative project? Were there any surprises along the way?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com&quot;&gt;Hackers Next Door&lt;/a&gt; was an incredible event, with over 25 speakers and two full days of workshops and talks. Unfortunately, we dramatically underestimated its popularity and as a result quickly ran out of capacity at our 100 person venue. In fact, we had to enlist several friends to act as bouncers as we realized that we would have to more strictly enforce our no-walk-in policy simply out of respect for our hosts and safety concerns at the space. So, until recently, Hackers Next Door was the largest event we ever facilitated. (We recently held an online event called Mr. Robot’s Hacker Happy Hour that more than doubled Hackers Next Door’s registration numbers.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although it did take a lot of coordination between teams (and, really, our core team went above and beyond the call of duty, personally hauling equipment like loudspeakers on the NYC Subway late into the night), we didn’t do anything particularly special to make the event happen. The biggest hurdle was simply coordinating with speakers, ensuring that all the confirmed speakers were given a time slot that they liked, and making sure that any special requests were taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Most of the coordination tasks were extremely well-regimented. Communication happened in a bulk and automated fashion. This just means we wrote email templates as the needs arose, and then sent out notices to the speaker or ticket holder lists via mail merge so everyone had the correct information about their specific session or ticket details. This is the kind of thing spreadsheets and computers have been doing since the 60’s and 70’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we think a lot of other groups could (should?) be making events like Hackers Next Door happen a lot more frequently, even with small organizing teams like ours. This message, that small groups of well-organized and skilled individuals can punch way above their weight, was what we hoped to have folks take away from their experience. The event itself was simply proof that it could be done in very little time, with very little money, and with few pre-existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tlc-is-incredibly-active-with-an-impressive-15-events-planned-for-may-and-even-more-in-june-how-does-your-group-share-this-workload-and-avoid-burnout-among-collective-members&quot;&gt;The TLC is incredibly active, with an impressive 15 events planned for May (and even more in June). How does your group share this workload and avoid burnout among collective members?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are three primary techniques we use to do this. These will be familiar to anyone who has ever worked in an office or held a position in management. They are: automation, separation of concerns, and partnerships. After all, just because we are anti-capitalist does not mean we ignore the obviously effective tools and techniques we have at our disposal for realizing our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The first pillar, automation, is really what we are all about. It’s what almost all of our classes teach in one form or another. In a Tech Learning Collective class, you will often hear the phrase, “If you ever do one thing on a computer twice, you’ve made a mistake the second time.” This is a reminder that computers were built for automation. That’s what they’re for. So, almost every component of Tech Learning Collective’s day-to-day operations are automated. This includes updating the Web site, publishing new events to the calendar, sending out Webinar access details to registered guests, adding (or removing) members from our various teams, syndicating (cross-posting) events to partner sites, and more. The only time a human needs to be involved is when another human wants to talk to us. Otherwise, the emails you’re getting from us were written many months ago and are being generated by scripts and templates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, separation of concerns: this is both a management and a security technique. In InfoSec, we call this the compartmentalization principle. You might be familiar with it as “need to know,” and it states that only the people who need to be concerned with a certain thing should have to spend any brainpower on it in the first place, or indeed have any access to it at all. This means that when one of our teachers wants to host a workshop, they don’t need to involve anyone else in the collective. They are autonomous, free to act however they wish within the limits of their role. This makes it possible for our collective members to dip in and out whenever they need to, thus avoiding burnout while increasing quality. If one of us has to step away for a while, the collective can still function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This kind of separation of concerns probably wouldn’t be possible without the automation we’ve put in place to automate the minutia of daily operations. Without that, we would need to at least double if not triple or quadruple the number of people who could devote many hours to managing the logistics of making sure events happen. But that’s boring, tedious, repetitive work, and that’s what computers are for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Finally, partnerships allow us to do things we could not do on our own. This also helps distribute the overarching workload, like creating practice labs or writing educational materials for new workshops. We work extremely closely with a number of other groups, which is possible because of our unique history in which our core collective members straddle several other activist and educational collectives. For example, one of our curriculum partners is Anarcho-Tech NYC, a collective of self-proclaimed anarchist hackers who provide digital security services for anti-fascist groups in New York City, with whom we collaborate on the bulk of our cybersecurity curriculum. This makes it feasible for us to take advantage of their work, while simultaneously supporting their efforts. It also means our teachers and, more importantly, our students have access to a much wider range of alumni opportunities than they would otherwise have had if we didn’t actively seek out and explore new partnership opportunities like these.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;at-the-time-of-writing-we-are-in-the-middle-of-the-covid-19-health-crisis-many-groups-are-struggling-with-shelter-in-place-but-fortunately-tlc-seems-to-have-adapted-very-well-what-are-some-strategies-you-are-employing-to-continue-your-work&quot;&gt;At the time of writing, we are in the middle of the COVID-19 health crisis. Many groups are struggling with shelter-in-place, but fortunately TLC seems to have adapted very well. What are some strategies you are employing to continue your work?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is almost an unfair question, because the nature of what we do at Tech Learning Collective lends itself well to the current crises.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The biggest change that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to adapt to is the shuttering of our usual venues for in-person workshops. Fortunately, we were already ramping up our online and distance learning options even before the pandemic. So we simply put that into high gear. The easily automatable nature of handling logistics for online events also made it possible to do many more of them, which is one reason you’re seeing so much more activity from us these days. The other reason, quite bluntly, is that a lot more people are finally willing to give online events a chance, making it far more worth our time to put them on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But also, there is widespread agreement within our collective that many effective strategies for organizing, or for continuing with daily work tasks, have actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; changed because of the pandemic. Yes, there is huge value in physical events and other in-person efforts, and obviously there is a whole class of labor that simply cannot be done entirely online. After all, this is exactly why “essential workers” are called essential; you may be able to order groceries over the Internet, but you can’t eat them off your laptop screen. That being said, it’s clear to us that the organizing strategies of the 90’s and the mass protest movements of the Occupy Wall Street era have proven largely ineffective against the neoliberal plague sickening society today, and that most white-collar “jobs” are, to paraphrase David Graeber, anthropologist and author of the 2018 book “Bullshit Jobs,” little more than a means of greasing the wheels of capitalist machinery which serves no ethical purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even before COVID-19 became the nightmare scenario that it has, we knew that effective political organizing required safe and secure telecommunication capabilities. The NSA, FBI, and CIA were spying on Americans long before 9/11 (COINTELPRO anyone?), much less before Zoom meetings became the de-facto “new normal.” And so, just as the Trump election in 2016 finally woke many people up to the things that privacy advocates have been saying for decades (“it’s not about whether you have something to hide, or whether you trust this government, it’s about whether you trust the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; administration”), we are seeing many people who have been under shelter-in-place orders finally wake up to other aspects of this reality that has already been with us for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In certain ways, for many in our collective, this “new normal” is actually a rather dated 90’s-era cyberpunk dystopia that we’ve been experiencing for many, many years. In that sense, we’re happy that you don’t have to enter this reality alone and defenseless. We kinda built Tech Learning Collective for exactly this scenario. We want to help you thrive here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;finally-what-does-the-future-look-like-for-tlc&quot;&gt;Finally, what does the future look like for TLC?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’re not sure! When we started TLC, we never thought it would end up becoming an online, international, radical political hacker school. In just the last two months since we’ve been forced to become a wholly virtual organization, we’ve held classes with students from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, London, Mexico, and beyond, as well as many parts of the United States of course. Many of them are now repeat participants working their way through our entire curriculum, which is the best compliment we could have asked for. We hope they’ll stick around to join our growing alumni community after that. We’re also (slowly) expanding our “staff” outside of New York City, which isn’t something we thought would happen for many years, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;So we’re excited about the possibilities of the future, even as we recognize the horrific state of the present situation. We would like to make new partnerships. We would like to hold more social events. For example, we loved the several Shift-CTRL Space “queer hacker parties” that we got to make some cool tech for and some in our crew are trying to figure out what the best way to replicate or even enhance that experience entirely online would be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But right now, we’re primarily focused on moving the rest of our in-person curriculum online and creating new online workshops. Many of the workshops unveiled this month or planned for next month are new, like our workshops on writing shell scripts, exploiting Web applications, auditing firewalls and other network perimeter defenses, and an exciting “spellwork” workshop to learn about the “spirits” that live on in the magical place inside every computer called the Command Line. So in the near future, expect to see more workshops like these, as well as more of our self-paced “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/&quot;&gt;Foundations&lt;/a&gt;” learning modules that you can try out anytime for free right in your Web browser from our Web site.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After that? Well, some say another world is possible. We’re hackers. Hacking is about showing people what’s possible, especially if they insist it could never happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Before we came together to create Tech Learning Collective, our members have been at Occupy Wall Street encampments, running &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/&quot;&gt;digital security workshops&lt;/a&gt; about anti-surveillance tools like TextSecure, which you may recognize today as &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;Signal Private Messenger&lt;/a&gt;. Others in our collective have been steering committee members for internationally-connected social centers, supported street medic operations in numerous American cities, and more. What makes us a collective is that all of us are convinced that the next chapter of the global movement for justice will end tragically if the movement as a whole does not dramatically and immediately invest in digital infrastructure education with a competency and urgency like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re doing our part as best we can by responding to rapidly shifting priorities with one eye on our short-term goals of the present moment, and the other firmly trained on our long-term goals. What are those goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the short term: Nurture our existing students through workshops and other &lt;a href=&quot;/events/calendar/&quot;&gt;educational opportunities&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2020/05/event-2020-05-29-hacker-trivia-night-restaurant-and-bar-night&quot;&gt;the recent Hacker Trivia Night&lt;/a&gt; so that they become capable of administering enterprise-grade, world-class, state-of-the-art Information Technology systems in support of the existing projects they are already involved in or to support the residents of the neighborhoods they currently live in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the medium term: Deploy and operate collectively-owned resilient critical telecom and other digital infrastructure supported by former students. Spread digital competencies in an “each one teach one” and “pay it forward” approach in which trainers train other trainers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the long term: smash the State, destroy capitalism, abolish globalized oppression inflicted by government, corporate, institutional, and interpersonal violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/2020-05-hacker-trivia-night-liberate_United-States.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Hacker Trivia Night challenge: &amp;ldquo;You get a disappearing Signal message from your friend informing you of a new &amp;lsquo;alt-right&amp;rsquo; group whose website claims it is active in your neighborhood. Your friend wants to know the legal identities of the site operators. What is the first tool you run?&amp;rdquo;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given our approach, it’s no surprise we believe that one of the most effective ways to get there from here is to train politically motivated people who already share our ethics and commitment to anti-racism, feminism, police and prison abolition, ecological justice, and other critical issues in the arts of hypermedia, Information Technology, and, yes, defensive and offensive cyber-warfare techniques. (Importantly, we have little to no faith in the political commitments of most existing and often quite liberal “Tech for Social Good” movements, although we would be fools not to accept their material contributions and financial donations.) We know this is a tall order, because these skills take time to develop, and also because organized, politicized efforts to teach these skills came slower and later than they should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, technologies that governments all over the globe deem to be cyberweapons have already been firing at civilians for decades. The only reason resistance was not louder sooner is because, unlike lead or rubber bullets, electronic bullets don’t bruise bodies. At least, not directly. Indirectly, however, they are a critical enabler of mass social control, making it possible for the rich to keep justice away from the poor, from women, from queer and trans people, and particularly from Black and brown people in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as we’ve seen time and time again, ballot boxes on their own don’t result in justice. Politicians simply ratify unjust laws written by lobbyists and police unions. More distressingly, adding laws of our own to the existing political system &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t result in justice, either. Authorities simply ignore the laws, hide their actions to avoid prosecution, or blatantly rewrite them. Not even the lofty concept of democracy, which is the fundamentally and fatally flawed idea of majority rule, does not result in justice. Things are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to fundamentally change for the better under a regime of “one person one vote” anymore than it would under the current “one dollar one vote” system the USA has today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/2020-05-hacker-trivia-night-liberate_Australia.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Hacker Trivia Night challenge: &amp;ldquo;Between the dates of January 1, 2015 and May 29, 2020 how many people are known to have been killed by police officers across the United States?&amp;rdquo;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an undeniable challenge, and we think there are many different good approaches we can take to addressing it. That’s why our goal is not to implement or even advocate for a specific approach, but rather to empower you to take actions you feel are appropriate backed, supported, and enabled by the awesomely potent power of the digital devices you already use every day. That computer you’re using to read this very post is arguably your most powerful asset because it—and it uniquely—can be both your pen and your sword at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, as protests against yet another murderer with a badge were held around the country and around the world, we went forward with our Hacker Trivia Night event in the hopes that participants new to cybersecurity would get a taste of what competent digital dexterity might feel like for them. We never feel able to pin this feeling down with words, so we were happy to see that one of our fellow Electronic Frontier Alliance member groups, DEFCON 201, recorded themselves participating in the event and provided a fantastic and fun introduction to Tech Learning Collective, along with a brief orientation to Hacker Trivia Night, for their own membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to recreate the experience in words, we present the first (minimally edited) ten minutes or so of their recording:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;/static/media/DC201 introduces TLC and Hacker Trivia Night.mp4&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as with each prior crisis, we’re seeing renewed interest in digital safety and security as more people recognize both how much more powerful control over digital infrastructure can make their campaigns as well as how central digital security culture is to the success of movement organizing. We’re honored to have been spoken of so highly by our fellow EFA member group, and we look forward to continuing to facilitate educational opportunities on cybersecurity and other IT infrastructure topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must recognize that the American State is a country whose Revolutionary War was premised on the protection of profits for its rich through the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. A country that was originally colonized through intentional, barbaric, continental-wide genocide. These are histories it continually seeks to downplay or whitewash, when justice demands exactly the opposite. Since its founding, the American government has made clear time and time again, over more than four centuries of indiscriminate, unaccountable, monstrous oppression, that they will cede &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; (even while they promise everything) without a demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans who have sat comfortably in the pot of slowly heating water that the capitalist class prepared for them are now seeing physical weapons once reserved for foreign wars sweep down residential streets. We once again find our firm but peaceful demands for peace, justice, and concrete rather than merely rhetorical equality for Black and brown people met with what would be criminally physical assaults had they not been perpetrated by gangs of badge-wearing executors of white supremacist genocide and terror called the police, an institution invented specifically to combat equality. Some who supported increased funding for either foreign wars or domestic police departments are shocked—shocked!—at the level of physical harm these government-funded legally-protected murderers and abusers in uniform are willing to dole out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all knew they had the weapons. Now we see—yet again—that they’re willing and, in some cases, even eager to use them. We have to become equally ready and able to competently use all the tools available to us: legal, physical, moral, and, once we acquire it, cyber power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue training together so that we can bring all our diverse powers to bear against this inhumane and unjust system. All power to the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;44,203 forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly important not to lose sight of larger goals, especially in times of distress. For us at Tech Learning Collective, that means taking stock of how we’re continuing to fulfil our original mission while taking care of ourselves and our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been our intention to find sustainable ways of scaling our educational efforts to more students—increasing &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt;—but we will never feel good about compromising the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of a student’s education to achieve that goal. This is particularly relevant for our subject matter, in which quantity &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be delegated to electronic devices and the entire point of education is to make a single, well-trained individual more capable than a hundred untrained operators. &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html&quot;&gt;This stubbornness set us apart from every other code bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; or employment-centric tech education initiative available to potential students since we started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, amid the almost constant bad news coming at us all, we thought we’d take a moment to share some of what’s been going well for us at Tech Learning Collective, and for some of our students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phenomenal-month-over-month-growth-in-every-area&quot;&gt;Phenomenal month-over-month growth in every area&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech Learning Collective has seen phenomenal month-over-month spikes in student sign-ups, scheduled events, and even workshop offerings ever since March. This has of course coincided with dramatically accelerated online event planning activities. Since we were well-prepared for stay-at-home orders and the sudden surge in demand for Internet video conferencing and remote learning opportunities, we were able to immediately offer many more workshops at much more flexible times during the week, and so we have reached many more students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-calendar-2020-05.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of our monthly &lt;a href=&quot;/events/calendar/&quot;&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt; showing our packed schedule from late April through early June. As you can see, we are running (online) workshops or other donation-based events almost every other day now. Our events now vastly outnumber &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; schools who were ranked in Course Report’s “Best Coding Bootcamps 2019–2020” report. Partly, of course, this is because Tech Learning Collective is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a code bootcamp, which means that we provide workshops on topics that include but do not end with or even focus on coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way this new growth can be seen is by simple Web analytics. Although we have never installed any Web bugs or trackers on our Web sites (that means there is no Google Analytics, social media buttons, or any other tracker on any of our pages), our server request logs have shown a sustained upward trajectory of Web traffic for many months running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/post.chart.2020-05-19.cloudflare-web-analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of the latest 30-day snapshot covering the period from mid-April 2020 through today (May 19, 2020). In May 2020, we hit 10,000 unique visitors (as measured by Cloudflare) for the month, and while some of this is due to spikes from much larger groups sharing news of our events, the trend is clear and stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another facet of this growth is to look at where our students are coming from. In 2019, our student population was entirely in New York City because we had no online offerings. While NYC residents are still the majority of our student population, in the last month and a half alone we have welcomed new students from over seven countries including Greece, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, and New Zealand, as well as more than ten States ranging from coast to coast within the United States, not including New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To both drive and support this, our small teaching team has been hard at work producing new workshops at breakneck speed. In the past two months alone, we have introduced more than a dozen new &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/&quot;&gt;online-ready workshops&lt;/a&gt;, as well as additional one-off events that have become several recurring series, such as our &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/04/02/mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights.html&quot;&gt;wildly popular “Mr. Robot’s Hacker Happy Hour” events&lt;/a&gt;. (Our &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2020/06/event-2020-06-27-mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour&quot;&gt;next Mr. Robot’s Hacker Happy Hour will be on June 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and will also be donation-based.) For a tiny team our size, we feel that this is an astonishing accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have been so good for Tech Learning Collective as an organization, despite some personal hardships endured by our team members including unemployment and reduced pay or hours at work, that we are slowly beginning to transition apprentices into teaching positions almost a year ahead of schedule. Since everyone at Tech Learning Collective is paid for their time, we were able to support our own collective members through this difficult period in a way that allows us to keep teaching classes. To be blunt, judging by how many other community groups have faced existential crises recently, we are not sure if Tech Learning Collective would have survived without the commitment of our educational team, the skill of our operations team, and the continued participation of our students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of our students….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;student-retention-and-participation-continues-to-soar&quot;&gt;Student retention and participation continues to soar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes Tech Learning Collective so different than code bootcamps, programmer retreats, or certification courses is the unparalleled interactivity and uniqueness of each event, workshop, or course. Thanks to our Socratic pedagogy, there is simply no way other training options can match the quality of a student’s educational experience at a Tech Learning Collective webinar workshop with one of our teachers. As a result, we’ve seen student retention and participation across all skill levels continue to soar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, since January 2020, the average Tech Learning Collective student purchased tickets to 2.58 workshops. But that’s the average, and it turns out that our student retention “bell curve” looks nothing like a bell at all. Here’s a chart showing the mathematical normal distribution of workshop ticket purchases by purchaser since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/post.chart.2020-05-19.normal-distribution-of-purchased-tickets.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice is that there is a hump between the 2.5 and 4.0 mark. This is because &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; students we’ve had since the start of the calendar year purchased a total of about two and a half tickets. Then there’s a steep drop-off, with very few students buying between between 4 and 6 tickets. But look at that spike over on the right. This shows that a remarkable number of students who attend one workshop return again and again, &lt;em&gt;more than six times in just over four months&lt;/em&gt; to participate in additional workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, since January, while most of our students have attended “only” two and a half paid events, there is a new cadre of students who have so far returned for five, six, and in one comitted student’s case, &lt;em&gt;thirteen&lt;/em&gt; separate webinar workshops. We know of no other tech education experience that is this “sticky,” to use a marketer’s phrase. Moreover, since this data only charts paid events, Tech Learning Collective’s actual retention numbers are even better than depicted here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think the reason Tech Learning Collective workshops are so worth returning to is really pretty simple: we are not focused on marketing! Instead, we make sure that &lt;a href=&quot;/about/#master-more-skills-more-quickly&quot;&gt;students leave class having internalized concepts and principles that will serve them for far longer and in more contexts than they would otherwise acquire&lt;/a&gt;. At code bootcamps, most students are doing little more than memorizing the syntax of some programming language, but at Tech Learning Collective, students are learning how to think critically about every challenge they face in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teachers actually teach, instead of simply pointing students towards references that we know they can find on their own using an Internet search engine. The result is an educational experience far more valuable, at far lower cost (both in terms of time and money), than can be achieved elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Tech Learning Collective’s sky-high student retention rate is just one data point in support of this claim. Rather than taking our word for it, here is what a few of our most recent students had to say about the classes they took this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tech Learning Collective is the best school, hands down, to learn about how to work with your computer. They offer regular workshops and longer courses, and have amazing, self-directed foundation courses about doing more with the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—Zach, May 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before taking the “&lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning&quot;&gt;Exploring Cyberspace: Network Sniffing and Scanning&lt;/a&gt;” class, I had some passing experience with one or two of the tools the instructor introduced. I would have considered myself a beginner. The instructor managed to take us into deep waters by illustrating small steps, making sure we understood the fundamental terminology, and asking us lots of questions. The scope of the class was thoughtfully limited—enough to make sure we could swim but also realize there is much more to learn. Quite an accomplishment in under two hours!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—David Schmudde, May 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I found Tech Learning Collective’s “&lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap&quot;&gt;Our Streets, Our Maps&lt;/a&gt;” was a highly informative and stimulating workshop. The instructor did an excellent job illustrating the great versatility of OpenStreetMap and demonstrating the wide range of queries it can satisfy. As someone who’d never before used OpenStreetMap, this workshop captured my imagination and has inspired me to plumb the depths of this valuable resource!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—August West, May 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read about a dozen more reviews published with permission on &lt;a href=&quot;/testimonials/&quot;&gt;our Testimonials page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unwavering-comittment-to-our-mission&quot;&gt;Unwavering comittment to our mission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another area that we find encouraging is the demographic breakdown of our student population. As a security-first technology school, we are operating in an extraordinarily militarized and male-dominated environment. However, at our workshops, including and especially our cybersecurity trainings such as our “&lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/World-Wide-Wars-Introduction-to-Exploiting-Web-Applications&quot;&gt;World Wide Wars: Introduction to Exploiting Web Applications&lt;/a&gt;” workshop, Tech Learning Collective consistently sees more women and femmes in attendance than men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exact demographic breakdown is impossible for us to provide because we don’t ask students to reveal their gender identity, race, or other demographic information as a condition of attendance to our public workshops. Also, our webinars are held online where students may never reveal any additional information about themselves beyond the words they type or nickname they use in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in order to keep ourselves accountable to our mission of serving primarily underrepresented communities, we sometimes conduct internal reviews of our progress and make some generic assumptions during the process of analyzing the data we do have. This includes classifying attendees along a coarse gender spectrum with three points (“femme,” “masc,” and “neutral”, in which we also include an implicit “unknown” gender category). The coding is keyed to a student’s preferred name in class, legal first name when their preferred name is missing or unclear, or email address when no other information was available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this system is not perfect. For example, it offers no direct insight into how many trans people have attended Tech Learning Collective workshops, and we happen to know for a fact that there are trans people among our recurring students. While we obviously take issue with such imperfect schemes when they are used as justifications to make it hard or impossible for an individual to access social, economic, or political resources, we feel that our use of this schema as a rough guide used to ensure that we remain true to our own core educational mission is both ethical and warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our analysis from data collected over the last five months, we can very happily say that we are succeeding like never before. Across all paid events since January 2020, exactly half (50%, or 1-to-1) of students presented in a manner that would be consistent with the mainstream’s understanding of women or feminine as compared with men or masculine (or gender-neutral).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/post.chart.2020-05-19.Estimated Binary Gender Breakdown by Total Students.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when limited to returning students (those participants who have purchased tickets to two or more events), this ratio changes to a dramatic 2-to-1. This means, among recurring students, women and femmes are exactly twice as likely to be present than men or masculine students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/post.chart.2020-05-19.Estimated Binary Gender Breakdown by Recurring Students.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider this a huge success because it bucks the trend that, to date, every single other mixed-gender educational environment has had immense trouble shaking. We primarily credit our amazing teaching team, who are themselves majority femme, with making this possible. They have gone to great lengths to ensure that each class is punctuated by what one student called “femme-friendly communications.” Additionally, our sliding scale or tiered pricing structure (borrowed from our experience in the queer party scene) in which straight, cis, white, and other societally privileged demographics are asked to pay more to offset the systemic oppressions prevalent in society and the tech sector especially, is clearly proving a useful technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data confirms our belief that it is not only possible, but economically sustainable to actually prioritize women and femmes even in what are traditionally viewed as intensely combative and needlessly hyper-masculinized fields such as cyber offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above is incredibly encouraging, we are a long way from our goal of a world in which political organizers and movement builders have the digital dexterity (the knowledge and skill, not just the tools) they need to radically reshape the world into a more just and peaceful place. At the end of the day, it will be up to our students, not us, to actually hack back against injustices and inequality using what they learn in our classes and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now, Tech Learning Collective remains comitted to completing our transition to a wholly virtual organization. We are continuing to work on bringing our more intensive courses online, and we are adding more online options to the rest of our curriculum very quickly. This month, our &lt;a href=&quot;/foundations/&quot;&gt;Foundations series&lt;/a&gt; of free, self-paced online learning modules has expanded yet again, and this will continue for the forseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has been supporting us, from our dedicated long-time collective members to our newest partners. As we continue to build out our cybersecurity-focused social justice movement technology education materials, we hope you’ll continue to help us spread the word amongst your friends and comrades about our webinars, workshops, and special events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your issue, effective advocacy requires competency and skill. Tech Learning Collective is committed to making sure you and your group have the skills you need to work effectively and safely in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tech Learning Collective</name><email>techlearningcollective@riseup.net</email></author><summary type="html">Tech Learning Collective was founded in an effort to radically increase the cybersecurity effectiveness and other digital capabilities of politically-motivated individuals and groups. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly important not to lose sight of larger goals, especially in times of distress. For us at Tech Learning Collective, that means taking stock of how we're continuing to fulfil our original mission while taking care of ourselves and our communities.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-calendar-2020-05.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/post.featured.tech-learning-collective-calendar-2020-05.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
