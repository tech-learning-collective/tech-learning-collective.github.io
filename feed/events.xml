In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so &lt;a href=&quot;#tickets-workshop-2020-10-11-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything&quot;&gt;purchase your ticket now&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard, Inc. use it every day, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet,” you probably heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; or its more colloquial synonym, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans, financial penalties, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard, immoral, and unsafe to use, but the reality is far less one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/em&gt; refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/141257/htg-explains-how-does-bittorrent-work/&quot;&gt;Blizzard, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company), who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular, cost-efficient, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeronet.io/&quot;&gt;ZeroNet&lt;/a&gt; are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinpeertube.org/en/&quot;&gt;PeerTube&lt;/a&gt;) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtorrent.io/faq&quot;&gt;WebTorrent&lt;/a&gt; to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find, download, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption, connecting to trackers through public proxies, and building private &lt;a href=&quot;https://seedboxgui.de/&quot;&gt;seedboxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution, so that you can connect securely to your home, office, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How often have you wished you could be in two places at once? That’s exactly what Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology was designed to allow computers to do. First popularized in 1996 by Microsoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol&quot;&gt;Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)&lt;/a&gt;, using VPN technology made it possible for two disconnected networks to be knit back together into one as long as each of them were connected to a third middle network, even if that middle network was hostile or untrusted. Today, that middle network is usually the Internet, which can certainly be hostile and untrusted! With a VPN, it’s possible to be “here” (on your actual network) and “there” (on the other side of the VPN connection) at the same time; by signing into a VPN service, you create a “VPN tunnel” that acts like a wormhole in space-time in that whatever you send into the tunnel emerges on the other side as though the two sides of the tunnel are next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Throughout the late 1990’s and 2000’s, VPN technology saw a surge in use among businesses looking for ways to enable remote workers. Using VPNs made it simpler for a colleague to travel because they could still be “directly connected” to their office network. By 2001, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvpn.org/&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; project made this amazing technology free and open source for GNU/Linux systems, with cross-platform implementations for Apple Macintosh and Windows arriving shortly thereafter. Today, OpenVPN servers form the bedrock of many modern free and commercial VPN solutions, and are still the most widely deployed VPN solution for most uses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you’ll get to see what happens when network packets are sent into VPN tunnels and how they appear on the other side in order to learn exactly how VPNs encapsulate—and secure—your computer’s communication with Web sites, office servers, or other services. You’ll see what it takes to set up your own OpenVPN server (not much!), as well as how to troubleshoot connection issues. You’ll also get introduced to several newer but less mature VPN protocols such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot;&gt;Wireguard&lt;/a&gt;, and learn about Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec&quot;&gt;IPsec&lt;/a&gt; and its related tunneling (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol&quot;&gt;L2TP&lt;/a&gt;) and security (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload&quot;&gt;ESP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange&quot;&gt;IKE&lt;/a&gt;, etcetera) protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution, so that you can connect securely to your home, office, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/workshop.two-places-at-once-understanding-virtual-private-networks.rectangle.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/workshop.two-places-at-once-understanding-virtual-private-networks.rectangle.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work</title><link href="http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/10/workshop-2020-10-04-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work" /><published>2020-10-04T16:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-04T16:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/10/workshop-2020-10-04-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/10/workshop-2020-10-04-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work">&lt;p&gt;This workshop is all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop derived from a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/net101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wireshark.org/&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol&quot;&gt;DHCP&lt;/a&gt; server misconfigurations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing&quot;&gt;ARP spoofing attacks&lt;/a&gt;, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.&lt;/p&gt;

Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses, the DNS is actually a massively distributed, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers, anti-spam DNS resource records, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the digital &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning&quot;&gt;world of cyperspace&lt;/a&gt; networks, such as the Internet, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic, such as Web browsing, email, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; in our Web browser?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The answer lies in DNS, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system, the DNS is actually a massive, distributed, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of &lt;em&gt;resource records (RRs)&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework&quot;&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail&quot;&gt;DKIM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC&quot;&gt;DMARC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities&quot;&gt;DANE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization&quot;&gt;CAA&lt;/a&gt; resource records), perform service discovery (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record&quot;&gt;SRV records&lt;/a&gt;), and more.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself, watching queries and replies, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers, called &lt;em&gt;resolvers&lt;/em&gt;, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the &lt;em&gt;zone&lt;/em&gt; in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnscrypt.info/&quot;&gt;DNSCrypt&lt;/a&gt; v2, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://crockford.com/&quot;&gt;Douglas Crockford&lt;/a&gt;, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; (or, &lt;em&gt;break out of&lt;/em&gt;) that system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zaproxy.org/&quot;&gt;OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open source Web application security scanner, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more. We’ll be targeting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/&quot;&gt;OWASP Juice Shop&lt;/a&gt;, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;OWASP Top Ten&lt;/a&gt;. They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, install malware on your systems, or penetrate your network.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/workshop.world-wide-wars-introduction-to-exploiting-web-applications.rectangle.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://techlearningcollective.com/static/images/workshop.world-wide-wars-introduction-to-exploiting-web-applications.rectangle.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail</title><link href="http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/09/workshop-2020-09-27-securing-email-protecting-everyday-communications-from-gmail-to-protonmail" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail" /><published>2020-09-27T16:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-27T16:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/09/workshop-2020-09-27-securing-email-protecting-everyday-communications-from-gmail-to-protonmail</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://techlearningcollective.com/events/2020/09/workshop-2020-09-27-securing-email-protecting-everyday-communications-from-gmail-to-protonmail">&lt;p&gt;This workshop shows you how to keep your emails private regardless of what email provider you use. By learning how to use the freely and widely available Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cryptosystem in email, you will see how easy it is to not only encrypt messages so that they remain confidential, but also how to make sure the emails you get were really sent by the people they claim to be from. Once you’re able to verify the sender of email you receive, you’re far less likely to get caught up in an email phishing scam ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail&quot;&gt;ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using &lt;a href=&quot;https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/&quot;&gt;freely available OpenPGP-compatible software&lt;/a&gt;, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so &lt;a href=&quot;#tickets-workshop-2020-09-27-securing-email-protecting-everyday-communications-from-gmail-to-protonmail&quot;&gt;purchase your ticket now&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass, fingerprint correlation, and other similar attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or, if you’re really skilled, completely anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals, and so too do politically vocal bloggers, investigative journalists, and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this specialized workshop, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services, and learn how how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers, network relays, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
