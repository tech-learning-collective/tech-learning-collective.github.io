If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop derived from a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/net101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wireshark.org/&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol&quot;&gt;DHCP&lt;/a&gt; server misconfigurations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing&quot;&gt;ARP spoofing attacks&lt;/a&gt;, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so &lt;a href=&quot;#tickets-workshop-2020-02-08-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work&quot;&gt;purchase your ticket now&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer, novelist, or art designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a &lt;em&gt;branch&lt;/em&gt;) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.&lt;/p&gt;

This workshop presents the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) the same way you might learn a new written language. By understanding the language’s grammar and vocabulary, you can compose surprisingly complex and powerful Web pages without needing to know a programming language like JavaScript. If you’ve used a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you have all the prerequisites you need to understand, at a deep and foundational level, what HTML is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/web101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course&lt;/a&gt;, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29&quot;&gt;Microdata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa&quot;&gt;RDFa&lt;/a&gt;, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veracrypt.fr/&quot;&gt;VeraCrypt&lt;/a&gt;), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN&quot;&gt;VLANs&lt;/a&gt;) or even the whole Internet (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetsim.org/&quot;&gt;INetSim&lt;/a&gt;), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qemu.org/&quot;&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt;), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proxmox.com/&quot;&gt;Proxmox&lt;/a&gt;). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qubes-os.org/&quot;&gt;Qubes Operating System&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html&quot;&gt;macOS’s App Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers&quot;&gt;Firefox Containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This beginner’s workshop taught by the &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective&lt;/a&gt;’s cybersecurity trainers offers &lt;a href=&quot;/about/persona-matrix/&quot;&gt;a simple framework&lt;/a&gt; anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix&quot;&gt;Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective&lt;/a&gt;, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://prism-break.org/en/&quot;&gt;there are many good and free tools available&lt;/a&gt;, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;), a password manager (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://keepass.info/&quot;&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 10 students, so &lt;a href=&quot;#tickets-workshop-2020-01-18-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security&quot;&gt;purchase your ticket now&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;/faq/#workshops-and-webinars&quot;&gt;our workshops and webinars FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

(Absolutely Everything!).&lt;/em&gt; Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this deep dive workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;https://torproject.org/&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective&lt;/a&gt;’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Promo code &lt;code&gt;REDUCED&lt;/code&gt; gets queer-identified and femme people $10 off their ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail&quot;&gt;ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using &lt;a href=&quot;https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/&quot;&gt;freely available OpenPGP-compatible software&lt;/a&gt;, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Class space is limited to 15 students! Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes early to reserve your seat and purchase your ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to bring a laptop to class, but may want to do so to follow along with the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

We offer unparalleled free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

This two-hour workshop is a practical introduction to creating, using, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artful.ly/store/events/19035&quot;&gt;$90 - Privacy Defender Workshop Ticket&lt;/a&gt;: Privacy Defender tickets are the recommended ticket type for those who can afford to help fund the digital security and online privacy advocacy communities with their financial resources, are attending the workshop with the support of their employers or other backers, or have other resources available to them. Purchasing tickets at this level makes it possible for us to offer reduced price tickets to those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veracrypt.fr/&quot;&gt;VeraCrypt&lt;/a&gt;), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN&quot;&gt;VLANs&lt;/a&gt;) or even the whole Internet (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inetsim.org/&quot;&gt;INetSim&lt;/a&gt;), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qemu.org/&quot;&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt;), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proxmox.com/&quot;&gt;Proxmox&lt;/a&gt;). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qubes-os.org/&quot;&gt;Qubes Operating System&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html&quot;&gt;macOS’s App Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers&quot;&gt;Firefox Containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualbox.org/&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tickets&lt;/strong&gt; to this workshop are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and are only available in advance via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artful.ly/store/events/19035&quot;&gt;our online storefront&lt;/a&gt;. Class space is limited to 15 students! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artful.ly/store/events/19035&quot;&gt;Purchase your ticket now to reserve your seat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to bring a laptop to class, but may want to do so to follow along with the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules&quot;&gt;our lightweight social rules&lt;/a&gt; for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
