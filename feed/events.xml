Maintaining the humble file server is among the most fundamental Information Technology (IT) department tasks in businesses or organizations big and small because most other activities revolve around document storage and retrieval. In this workshop, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises, like NFS, SMB, and WebDAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As early as 1964, computer makers like IBM, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably, secured properly, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These days, however, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized, individuals, community groups, political organizers, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, and Dropbox Paper come in, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free, Libre, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself, for a small group of friends, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV&quot;&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt; to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage&quot;&gt;Network-Attached Storage (NAS)&lt;/a&gt; devices like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol&quot;&gt;(Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)&lt;/a&gt; that are common in Web hosting environments, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29&quot;&gt;Network File System (NFS)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block&quot;&gt;Server Message Block (SMB)&lt;/a&gt; protocols that are common in homes and offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so &lt;a href=&quot;#tickets-workshop-2021-06-20-something-for-everyone-file-servers-and-other-network-attached-storage&quot;&gt;purchase your ticket now&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.&lt;/p&gt;

While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials, like how to understand the concept of document flow, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size, position, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries, modern layout modules, and other CSS capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All physical mediums like print, music, or film can be beautiful, but they will always be constrained by the fact of their analog nature. Digital media—and specifically hypermedia—is different. It can change both its form and its function, simultaneously presenting itself as any one or a combination of multimedia formats without changing its underlying structure. The humble Web page is a good example: it can stretch to fit your screen when viewed in a Web browser, lay itself out on a page to prepare for being printed, and even embed voice cues so it can be more easily listened to when read aloud. All of this is done using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), one of the most powerful, and most often misused, features of the modern Web.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although the CSS language itself is decades old now, its origins are even older. Rooted in the idea that form and function can simultaneously coexist in a multitude of different arrangements, CSS makes it possible for a single well-formed digital object to appear in the “best” way to any given viewer (or reader, or listener). This is a radical departure from physical media, like paper, and it requires an equally radical departure from some traditional graphic design paradigms that demands we spend an equal amount of time exploring philosophical issues like “the eye of the beholder” as it demands that we familiarize ourselves with technical implementation details such as the mathematical equations determining when, where, and how to draw specific shapes or colors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This workshop builds on the concepts of hypertext introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/The-Web-as-a-Language-What-No-One-Ever-Told-You-About-HTML-That-You-Didn't-Know-To-Ask&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s “The Web as a Language” workshop&lt;/a&gt; by speaking of fundamental CSS concepts often omitted from other tutorials, such as “User Agents,” document flow, and rendering contexts. You’ll learn how both the design and the function of your digital creations can benefit from approaching hypermedia more fluidly, so you can work with the CSS rendering engine in most modern graphical programming environments rather than fighting against it. Like water, your Web pages, apps, and other hypertextual creations will be able to flow seamlessly into vessels of any shape, Operating System, or Web Browser vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

Learn how to automatically monitor and alert on operational issues such as resource exhaustion before they take down your servers and applications. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the “four golden signals” of observability, you’ll be introduced to time series databases and metrics collection with Prometheus, and you’ll learn how to create beautiful charts and graphs from that data with Grafana. Together, these free, industry-standard tools comprise the foundation of all modern and cloud-native IT monitoring stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every computer program needs certain resources to operate well, like memory and disk space and CPU cycles. This is true both for simple programs on your laptop and also for complex, cloud-native systems like those that run in massive compute clusters in public cloud or on-premises datacenters. On a single computer, tools like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac&quot;&gt;Activity Monitor&lt;/a&gt; on macOS or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/405806/windows-task-manager-the-complete-guide/&quot;&gt;Task Manager&lt;/a&gt; on Windows can report which applications are taking up what amount of specific resources on your computer in near real-time, helping you keep watch over your digital domain. When you need to monitor whole fleets of servers, though, you need tools that can scrape or collect the same information from those servers over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In decades past, IT teams were often limited to static data sets to perform tasks like asset tracking. As applications grew more complex, performance and reliability metrics became increasingly important, so instrumentation, profiling, and visualization tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/health-checks/&quot;&gt;dedicated health and readiness checks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Performance/Flame_Chart&quot;&gt;flame charts&lt;/a&gt; were developed to help engineers figure out how to both optimize the code they wrote and how to integrate it with other systems more seamlessly. Today, specialized frameworks and burgeoning standards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; are designed to give system operators more visibility into both the current and historical usage trends and patterns of the resources their services need to run well. Equipped with this information, they can make better capacity planning decisions for the future or even help identify anomalous events like security breaches, bugs in code, and other subtle issues that might be hard or impossible to track down otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you’ll be introduced to the concepts and practices of observability for infrastructure at any level of scale. You’ll learn about the “four golden signals”—latency, traffic, errors, and saturation—and why they matter. Like the four Quarters that are called to cast a magical circle, each golden signal has a particular focus and almost elemental meaning. You’ll learn how to install and configure &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, the open, industry-standard metrics collection solution on which many commercial offerings are based, along with its accompanying components like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/&quot;&gt;Alertmanager&lt;/a&gt;, metric &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/&quot;&gt;exporters&lt;/a&gt;, and supplemental software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; that can query Prometheus’s time series database to reveal trends, patterns, or anomalies in your systems’ stability over time. Finally, to make sense of all this data, you’ll get an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/&quot;&gt;PromQL&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose-built Prometheus Query Language used for everything from triggering alerts to making custom queries so you’ll always be able to know exactly what’s going on in your infrastructure when you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/web101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course&lt;/a&gt;, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29&quot;&gt;Microdata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa&quot;&gt;RDFa&lt;/a&gt;, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;

A phishing attack is surprisingly low-tech, which is part of what makes it so devastatingly effective. Learning to spot these attacks is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself online, since a hacker’s tricks, called “lures,” can appear anywhere from an email, to a Facebook message, to a real Web site that looks exactly like one you recognize! In this workshop, you’ll learn how frighteningly easy it is to build these scam sites, and all about the tricks they use to fool you into falling for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people do get caught up by them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html&quot;&gt;ninety percent (90%!)&lt;/a&gt; of reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches&quot;&gt;data breaches&lt;/a&gt; began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses &lt;a href=&quot;https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html&quot;&gt;over $12 billion in losses&lt;/a&gt;. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites&quot;&gt;one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and &lt;em&gt;offered&lt;/em&gt; to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, derived from a portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/sec101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course&lt;/a&gt;, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://crockford.com/&quot;&gt;Douglas Crockford&lt;/a&gt;, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; (or, &lt;em&gt;break out of&lt;/em&gt;) that system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zaproxy.org/&quot;&gt;OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open source Web application security scanner, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more. We’ll be targeting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/&quot;&gt;OWASP Juice Shop&lt;/a&gt;, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;OWASP Top Ten&lt;/a&gt;. They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, install malware on your systems, or penetrate your network.&lt;/p&gt;

In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

This intermediate-level workshop introduces you to Terraform, a free, agentless, masterless, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) digital operations provisioning tool used by many of the largest organizations in the world but simple enough to use on a team of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there was the mainframe: a single, gigantic machine that held all the data and did all the work by itself, like a digital planet suspended in the vast emptiness of cyberspace. Then came networks, the personal computer, the Internet, Web 2.0, cloud computing, microservices, and containers—a whole &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning&quot;&gt;cybergalaxy to explore&lt;/a&gt;. While the world today looks very different than it did in the days of the mainframe, every project still needs to start at the beginning: get at least one computer to hold all project data and do all project work. So how do modern projects go from a single computer to a whole galaxy so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For many (including Tech Learning Collective!), the answer is &lt;a href=&quot;https://terraform.io/&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;, a free, open source, and extensible tool that can provision and manage any number of infrastructural resources from source code repositories to cloud compute instances to DNS records and much, much more. Using Terraform, engineers describe the digital environment they’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to have by writing it down in a simple, declarative configuration language called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html&quot;&gt;HCL&lt;/a&gt;. Then, when instructed, Terraform does the work of metaphorically, well, terraforming cyberspace to match the engineer’s description.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of how to set up Terraform for your organization. We’ll also go over best practices for ensuring testing, staging, and production infrastructures stay isolated from one another, how to compose reusable modules, and how to share your Terraform configurations as well as project state with collaborators. At the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how to bring the cloud down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have you been “pwned”? For years, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/a&gt; that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is, if your personal information such as your password, has been leaked, accessed, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on, check for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been “pwned,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the &lt;a href=&quot;/courses/sec101.html&quot;&gt;Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course&lt;/a&gt;, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side, learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/mr-robots-netflix-n-hack/week-2/strengthening-passwords-to-defend-against-john/README.md&quot;&gt;professional techniques for recovering passwords&lt;/a&gt; from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation, such as using optimized wordlists, word-mangling rulesets, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

In a way, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At their core, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper, they allow us to record our thoughts, dreams, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors, industrial control systems, biomedical devices, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose, text-only interface called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/foundations/&quot;&gt;command line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Individually, these instructions are called &lt;em&gt;invocations&lt;/em&gt;. (Yes, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to write whole spells, rituals, or (sacred) texts called &lt;em&gt;shell scripts&lt;/em&gt; to inscribe your own thoughts, dreams, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By saving your scripts in files, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and, as such, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
