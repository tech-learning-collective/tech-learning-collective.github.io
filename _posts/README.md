# The `_posts` folder

This folder contains the blog posts that are ultimately published to your website's blog pages. Whenever you save a new file into this folder, Jekyll checks to see if it "looks like" a blog post. If it does, Jekyll creates a new page on your website for the blog post, and automatically adds the post to the many blog-aware listing pages.

For Jekyll to recognize a file in this folder as a blog post, each file must meet the following criteria:

* Its file name must be formatted like this:
  ```
  YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
  ```
  For example, a file called `2018-05-28-my-first-post.md` will create a blog post published on May 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018 whose title is "My First Post." The `.md` at the end tells Jekyll that you intend to write the post using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but you can also use a `.html` extension if you wanted to write in raw HTML, yourself.
* The file must begin with [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). Specifically, it must start with three dashes, then a newline, then another three dashes, like this:
  ```
  ---
  ---

  Your blog post body here.
  ```
  Inside the lines with three dashes on them, you can add any number of [custom fields](#custom-fields) (metadata) to the blog post. However, even if you don't add any custom fields, you must include the front matter (the dashes) in order for Jekyll to recognize your file as a blog post.

See also [Jekyll's documentation for writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

## Custom fields

Your blog posts can have custom metadata attached to them. This lets you do things like add a featured image to represent the main point of the post visually, associate the blog post with a specific event listed in your [`events.csv` data file](../_data/README.md#events), set a title different than the one in the file name, change the publication date, include an author's byline, and more.

Custom fields must be written inside the Jekyll Front Matter block (the lines with only three dashes on them) at the very start of the file. To add a custom field, you write its name, followed by a colon (`:`), followed by a single space, followed by the value you want. If the value you want includes a colon (`:`), you must enclose the value in double quotes. For example, to set a custom metadata field called `my_custom_metadata` with a value of `Special event: Dance of the Ages!`, you would add a line like this within the Front Matter portion of your blog post:

```yaml
my_custom_metadata: "Special event: Dance of the Ages!"
```

The rest of this section describes the custom fields that come built-in with your website's template.

### `event_summary`

Add an `event_summary` field to associate the blog post with an event in [your site's `events.csv` data file](../_data/README.md#events). The value of the field must match exactly the value of the `Summary` field in the data file. For example, if you have an event with a `Summary` of `Weekly Karaoke Night!`, you can associate this blog post with that event using the following custom field:

```yaml
event_summary: "Weekly Karaoke Night!"
```

Associating a blog post with an event will import the event data onto the blog post itself and provide a direct download link in iCalendar format at the end of the post that lets visitors easily add the event to their personal digital calendar.

### `featured`

Use the `featured` custom field to showcase a specific blog post in a prominent place on your Website, such as your home page. The only valid value is `true`.

### `image`

If you have already uploaded an image (perhaps to [your site's `static/images` folder](../static/images/)), you can use it as the featured image for this post by writing the path to the file as the `image` custom field. For example, assuming an image whose file name is `karaoke-event-poster.jpg` exists in the `static/images` folder, use this custom field value to make that image the featured image for this post:

```yaml
image: static/images/karaoke-event-poster.jpg
```

### `title`

Set this custom field to override the title of your post that was automatically generated from the post's filename.
