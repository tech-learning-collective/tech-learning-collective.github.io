*Brooklyn, NY &mdash; {{ page.date | date: site.date_format }}* &mdash; For two full days on the weekend of December 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>, resident New Yorkers fighting against invasive corporate and dragnet government surveillance will share the stage with national technology law and policy watchdogs at *Hackers Next Door 2019*, an information security and social technology conference featuring presentations by the best of the tri-state area&rsquo;s cybersecurity trainers, privacy rights advocacy groups, activist networks, and their constituencies. Hosted by the [Tech Learning Collective]({% link index.html %}), an apprenticeship-based tech school at their semi-permanent residency with [Triangle Arts Association](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/sponsors/#triangle-arts-association) in Brooklyn&rsquo;s DUMBO neighborhood, conference organizers cite the need to help grassroots campaigns and local community groups put more pressure on lawmakers and the for-profit technology sector as a driving force behind the event.

&ldquo;We chose to feature the work of local, grassroots activists alongside more established non-profits because we believe in the power of &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; organizing,&rdquo; said a spokesperson for the conference. &ldquo;The national conversation is ultimately driven by what happens on the local level, and we wanted to highlight that.&rdquo;

The conference&rsquo;s speaker lineup includes names you know, such as [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#freedom-of-the-press-foundation-fpf), who maintain SecureDrop and who count Edward Snowden among their Board of Directors, the [Tor Project](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#tor-project), makers of the Tor Browser, and the [Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.)](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#surveillance-technology-oversight-project-stop), who help craft privacy laws such as the [Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act](https://www.stopspying.org/post-act), as well as many you might not. Also on the program are [tenants of the Atlantic Plaza Towers complex](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#brooklyn-legal-services-tenants-rights-coalition-bls-lsnyc) who are fighting against their landlord&rsquo;s plans to force them to submit to facial recognition algorithms to access their homes, members of the semi-elusive [Shift-CTRL Space](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#shift-ctrl-space) hacklab who are working to build community-owned Internet and intranet infrastructure in Queens, and Brooklyn-based creative technologist [Ari Melenciano who founded the AFROTECTOPIA new media festival](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#afrotectopia) on a shoestring budget.

Alongside the many sessions about legal policy or anti-racist and anti-oppressive organizing, the conference stays true to its name by including numerous digital security workshops facilitated by world-class cybersecurity trainers, classic hacking demos such as phishing and Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by &ldquo;anonymous members&rdquo; of self-proclaimed Anarchist tech collective [Anarcho-Tech NYC](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#anarcho-tech-nyc), and even an exploration of illegal broadcasts by legendary Brooklyn-based pirate radio station founder DJ Cintronics, courtesy of the [Brooklyn Pirate Radio Sound Map (BPRSM)](https://hnd.techlearningcollective.com/speakers/#brooklyn-pirate-radio-sound-map-bprsm) project.

Organizers said that scheduling hacking demos back-to-back with organizing strategy sessions was an intentional choice. &ldquo;For us at Tech Learning Collective, it&rsquo;s important to have both uncompromising pro-social politics and unparalleled technical competency so that we can not only envision a more just, less unequal future, but also build power beyond mere voter representation to enact that vision ourselves,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Activists need to see first-hand exactly what threats government-funded hackers and cyberwarfare units&mdash;and especially cyber-augmented class warfare&mdash;pose to their work, or they won&rsquo;t be able to defend themselves, communicate freely, or organize safely. We wanted this conference to give us a better chance to win all the legal, cultural, and technical battles we&rsquo;ve been forced to fight.&rdquo;
