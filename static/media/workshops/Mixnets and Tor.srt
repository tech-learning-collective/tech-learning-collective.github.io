1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.260
Right. So this is known as cryptographic mixnet.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.995
M-I-X-N-E-T, and the idea here is that because we have a blind node in the middle there,

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.100
then if we can trust some, which is to say, enough of a percentage of the network,

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.320
then you are reducing the amount of metadata and information that can be gathered by your adversary

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.020
such as the NSA. Not saying it's perfect and there's definitely been traffic correlation,

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.500
you know, issues and, but those are not vulnerabilities of the Tor system.

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.020
The Tor system as it exists today,

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.300
in sort of like a design, right is as robust as it was in the 90's when it was developed in the Naval Research Lab at the Naval Research Laboratory NRL

9
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600
the US NRL or something like that.

10
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.300
And that's because the design is a mixnet.

11
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.780
Just like for example, if you familiar with Bitcoin tumblers

12
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.280
where you basically do Bitcoin money laundering, right?

13
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.960
Cleaning money from Bitcoin. That's the same principle.

14
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.580
You send a bunch of data in, so it's hard to figure out where that data comes out.

15
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.600
That is, we look at, for example, a cryptographic mix net on Wikipedia.

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.820
This is what you want to read, if you want to know more about that.

17
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.860
And what's—mix network. Yeah.

18
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.067
And what's really cool about this, this sort of paradigm is that as long, again, as long as you can trust some nodes,

19
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.860
then you have a very, very high probability of making it at best or, you know,

20
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.420
at worst, extremely hard for your adversary to find stuff out about you.

21
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.440
We know, the NSA has trouble with Tor. We've seen that in the Snowden slides since 2013.

22
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.080
Tor itself, the cryptographic protocols are not broken.

23
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.240
There are sometimes bugs in Tor Browser, which is primarily a Firefox issue, right?

24
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.780
If we go to for example, Tor browser and go to about Tor Browser, you'll see it's based on Mozilla Firefox,

25
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.040
which is one reason why we tell you constantly keep your software up to date.

26
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.240
You'll see a little green icon here if your Tor browser is out of date. And the minute you see that you want to update.

27
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.880
In fact, you may even want to go to "About Tor Browser" before you do anything else because the first thing that—when you open Tor Browser—because what it does is it updates.

28
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.880
Here Tor browser is up to date, right it checks for an update.

29
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.124
So, most things when you hear Tor has been hacked, it's actually Firefox browser has a vulnerability in it,

30
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.560
which is almost always solvable for most people. Just by doing this.

31
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860
About -> Tor Browser, and you're up to date.
