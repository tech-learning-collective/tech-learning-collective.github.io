1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,520
This is sort of where the like, it's good to know how the tool works so that you can use it.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,780
So you understand what it's doing.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,480
But it is also just as important for you to know how to use the tool, right?

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,440
It's not important thatâ€”you need to both know how to use it safely and what it is doing.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,440
How it works.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,080
Only knowing one of them right doesn't cover you.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,940
Knowing how it works might have you be very knowledgeable about sort of the technical side,

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,660
but not knowing how to use it safely means that your OPSEC, your operational security,

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,240
could be compromised.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,860
And what I mean by that is simply the things you do your operations,

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,540
right, could be compromised simply by stuff you do that the technology is not designed or not equipped to protect you against.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,980
So if I go to facebook.com and I log in here,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,540
right let's say I'm you know, Shayla and I suddenly, nah, let's say I'm Sam Elliot cuz Shayla doesn't use,

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,540
nah, let's use Shayla,  'cause let's make her awesome.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,020
shayla@mac.com right, can I type in my password here?

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,360
If I were to log in? This is not obviously a real Facebook account. But if it was,

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,900
you know, what would be happening here? Why would this potentially compromise

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,300
my Tor connection to at least Facebook?

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,860
Yes, Facebook does have an onion site. In fact, let's go there facebookcorewwwi.onion.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,440
Well, so Razi says whoever owns the end node gets your creds.

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
It's not so much about the end node in this case, right?

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,440
Because, theoretically, especially with the Facebook, onion service, right,

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,900
and also the HTTPS connection that we're making to,

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,640
to Facebook right, the end node here. Well, I guess now we're on the onion site. Let's go back.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,260
The exit node right is not going to know our creds because we are still HTTPS encrypted, right?

26
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,680
We have that little lock icon we can see that it's, the actual certificate

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,560
by Facebook so if I actually inspect the certificate super closely,

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,780
you can see that the SHA 256 fingerprint here is going to match Facebook's.

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,440
But in any event, the point is that if it's encrypted, then the exit node isn't going to know your creds,

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,520
the site you're going to log into, it's going to know your creds, right.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,160
And the point here is that Facebook has like fucking bugs everywhere, right?

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,320
Like, I mean, what sites do you go to that doesn't have a Facebook like icon.

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,940
And so if you're now browsing around to different sites, Tor browser will try to do some things to protect you in that scenario, it's called circuit isolation.

34
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,600
But you know, because Facebook is sort of has one of these that really

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,240
wide reaching you know, there weren't there you can basically think of them as like the Internet Five Eyes, right?

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,460
The Five Eyes are like those nation states that have come together, the United States, England, I think Australia,

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,660
there's a couple of others but the point is like Facebook is basically like a five eye,

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,460
right like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, the FAANG, you know,

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,960
Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google thing. Yeah.

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Those companies have like web bugs basically fucking everywhere on every fucking website.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,440
And so if you go to a bunch of different sites, after logging into Facebook on Tor Browser, then it is possible

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,340
through traffic correlation for Facebook to potentially start to get some profile of you, right.

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,080
And so it's not bad to log into Facebook, feel free to do that over Tor Browser.

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:33,460
But it's not necessarily something you want to then immediately start doing like stuff that you would maybe not want to search like, you know,

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,240
you know, I'm not gonna do that right now, but

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
in the same tab, or in the same session.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,220
And so in between those two things, you want to click this button, the New Identity button,

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,300
and that'll sort of wipe your Tor browser history in a certain way, give you a new circuit etc.

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,220
And that's what this is for.

50
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,300
So this is for unlinking your previous activity to your future activity.
