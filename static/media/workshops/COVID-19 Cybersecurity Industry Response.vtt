00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.440
I'm actually super pleased to see finally for the first time I think that I have ever seen this happen—

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.680
dear cybersecurity industry if any of you folks like work in AppSec or InfoSec like—this is,

3
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:26.080
we are helping out civic services and volunteer groups and activist groups with our expertise far too little far too late.

4
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.220
Right. But basically, there's like the COVID-19 cybersecurity response now,

5
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.700
that folks that people are doing, who are in the industry, who are sitting there setting up the equivalent of like, you know, a Slack channel

6
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.020
for, you know, cross company collaboration, but now they're offering that pro bono to

7
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.560
critical infrastructure services like hospitals and health care providers and this sort of stuff,

8
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.940
smaller groups that are doing for example, home deliveries that are trying to set up websites and this kind of stuff.

9
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.900
That's great to see. Too little too fucking late! But you know, it's something.

10
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.260
And I'm glad to see that because that's really great.

11
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.900
We need more of that kind of pro bono work that is not governmental in nature,

12
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.260
that is just actual mutual aid, like for real people helping people, because they're neighbors, right?

13
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.140
Like, I like to say that just because you know, you have running water doesn't mean you want to be a plumber,

14
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.860
and you shouldn't have to be a plumber.

15
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.240
But someone in your community should fucking be a plumber,

16
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140
because you're going to be better off when your pipes break.

17
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.920
Someone in your community should fucking be a system administrator, should fucking be, you know, doing some kind of infosec

18
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.740
and those people should then help those folks who don't want to do that full time.

19
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440
And so it's good to see that happen.

20
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.940
So primarily, we're seeing ransomware attacks, primarily, we're seeing obviously continuation with phishing.

21
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.100
Those are sort of tied together obviously,

22
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.380
because a lot of, y'know, over 90% of the footholds in corporate networks

23
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.660
are going to be phishing related in some, some way, one way or another.

24
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.700
We do, for what it's worth, have an entire phishing workshop that is about Web based

25
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.800
social engineering attacks. So we show how phishing works.
