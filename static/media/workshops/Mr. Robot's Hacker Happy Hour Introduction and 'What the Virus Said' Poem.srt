1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,580
Hopefully you got a drink, you got settled, you watched the first episode of the show.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,180
For most of this hour, maybe even longer if we're having a good time,

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,680
we're just going to talk tech, we're going to talk hacking.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,540
We're gonna see what we can play around with that was actually on the show.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:27,420
And we will just do a sort of a Q&A and answer questions and, maybe show some demos and this kind of thing.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,660
Before that, though, because there's so many of you here that I have not seen before,

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,010
and I think many for many of you, this might be your first introduction to the Tech Learning Collective,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,560
I wanted to let you know who we are.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:50,020
So TLC, right, is a collective of some radical folks in the United States primarily with some friends around the country,

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,300
around the continent, I should say,

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,680
and some around the globe. We do educational courses like this.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,060
So if you haven't noticed, come by to some of our events before,

13
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:07,520
you can sign up on our events page, you'll see a calendar listing of the stuff that we're doing.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,300
You can see some upcoming events. Soon. Next week, we do workshops on Tor,

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,120
we do workshops on in this case, we're trying went out on BitTorrent.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,700
Some basic networking things, we often do offensive and defensive, hacking demonstrations in educational environments.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,540
We just did a gone phishing workshop, which was about web based social engineering attacks, you might get some of that, some of that stuff.

18
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,880
But they're typically low cost, free, or donation based events.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,760
They are remote typically thanks, of course, to the virus, and we do them sort of at our whenever we can.

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:53,160
So it's a small collective of a couple of folks. And we just kind of try to have fun with it and teach people what they need to know.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,100
So that's who we are. We are also partners with a number of different groups.

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:10,580
And you might see some references to some of them. In particular, I want to point a great big shout out to the Anarcho-Tech NYC group,

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,920
which is an organization here in New York City that partners with us to do a lot of sort of educational curriculum building.

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:29,600
And they provide anti fascist, anti racist, anti capitalist organizations in New York City with digital security services, including penetration tests and different kinds of hands on infrastructure support.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,130
So if you're in New York City, especially take take note of this.

26
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,400
We use their social rules for our own events. And since this is a huge, huge event,

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,140
I just want to go over these super quick:

28
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,150
first, basically, again, this is both free and we're doing it for fun.

29
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,150
So that means if we're not having fun, more specifically, if I'm not having fun, this stops, it's as simple as that.

30
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,580
We don't have any time or you know, budget for policing people's behavior and this kind of stuff.

31
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,820
We'll simply ban you from all this event and all future events, we have the technology to do it.

32
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,170
It's not hard. You're a couple of bytes in a spreadsheet for us. So like, don't, don't, you know, don't don't spoil it for us.

33
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,840
We want this to be a lot of fun.

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:19,040
Super briefly, the rules, be supportive. Don't, don't you know, there was always a period in someone's time

35
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,180
period in someone's life when they didn't know something. We're not here to make fun of how little people know.

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,060
We're here to help people know more. So don't, you know, you—I'm sure you were in that maybe a tech group at some point and someone said,

37
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,440
"Oh, my God, you don't know what a pull request is?" Or, "Oh my god, you don't know what a command line is?"

38
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,880
Like, don't don't bother with that. Just say, hey, command line is this, you know, help them fill in some gaps in their knowledge instead of

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,380
beating them down for some for stuff they don't know. Especially noobs.

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,180
We want this to be a noob friendly environment. Cool?

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,840
All right. Secondly, don't you know, try to chime in with stuff that isn't proportional to what we're dealing with.

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,220
Yes. Someone might get some technical thing tiny bit wrong or like there might be you know, a teeny error in someone's—that's fine.

43
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:08,200
You know, we're here to talk about big picture concepts and philosophies. We're not trying to figure out exactly what the syntax of JavaScript is. No one cares. Okay?

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,440
Be engaged, be here, maybe go again, grab a drink, relax.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,780
Just get rid of some distractions, put your phone down.

46
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,760
Also, please don't ask us to do illegal shit.

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,480
We get asked that too much. Right? Keep it legal when we're in public, and we're in public now.

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:32,780
So you know, so please don't please don't ask us to hack on your behalf. We won't do it. We'll ban you.

49
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,160
Next, just assume that we're all trying to have a good time here. Right?

50
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,480
This is just you know, don't assume that people aren't, don't call out people as Feds and this sort of shit. We don't have time for that either, all right?

51
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,270
Next, just be serious about the fact that we're doing this, to have fun that there are some politics involved in these sort of things.

52
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,000
You know, we're talking about surveillance technology. That gets political.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,740
We're not here to debate the merits of this or that political belief. We all have beliefs on that.

54
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,280
We're doing this for free. I don't care what your politics are, if you are here, and you want to learn, and you don't share our politics,

55
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,290
that's fine, but shut the fuck up about it. It's as simple as that. We don't want to talk about that at this point.

56
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,440
So those are our rules.

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,820
Now, tonight is our very first, right, our very first Hacker Happy Hour that we are doing remotely.

58
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:30,310
It is, of course, spurred by the incredibly tragic pandemic that's happening.

59
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,780
And before we get too much on the Mr. Robot stuff, I do want to just say like, you know,

60
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,400
this is unprecedented and I just want to acknowledge the fact that this is hard for a lot of people.

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm personally worried about my family. I hope that everyone's families are okay. And I know that all of you have someone who is either,

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,380
you know, stressed by it, personally, immediately affected by it.

63
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,180
And I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the profound moment in history that this represents, okay?

64
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:06,740
So in a nod to the seriousness of that situation, I'd like to very, very briefly read a translated poem, excerpt of the poem.

65
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,580
I know this is not what you came for, but I'm gonna, you know, this is for free. And it's, my stage at the moment. So I'm going to do it. It's not going to take too long.

66
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,460
But I want us to recognize how important this is and why

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,100
this is, you know, now something that things like telework, things like remote work, things like all the

68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,960
importance of understanding the technology that we that we use every day, the networks that we have, right,

69
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,740
those of you who understand how this is going to work, it's—you're going to be in a much better position, we want you to have that power.

70
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,920
So with that in mind, let me briefly read to you what we've got in this poem.

71
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,800
This poem for what it's worth is from our friends in France.

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,540
They are from the French autonomous movement. And they've written a poem, or published a poem called

73
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,560
"What the Virus Said." And it goes like this.

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,350
I have come to shut down the machine whose emergency break you couldn't find.

75
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,900
I've come in order to suspend the operation that held you hostage.

76
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,250
I've come in order to demonstrate that aberration, the aberration of normalcy, what it constitutes.

77
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,980
Politicians now, they suddenly say "There is no budgetary limit. Health has no no price."

78
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,420
See how I redirect the language and spirit of your governing authorities.

79
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,120
See how I bring them down for you to their real standing as miserable racketeers, and arrogance to boot!

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,060
For them, you are nothing but supports for the reproduction of their system—that is, less than slaves.

81
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,940
Even the plankton are treated better than you.

82
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:43,200
But don't waste your time reproaching them. Pointing out their deficiencies. Accusing them of negligence is still to give them more credit than they deserve.

83
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,020
Ask yourselves, rather, how you could find it so comfortable to let yourself be governed.

84
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:55,760
Praising the merits of the Chinese option compared to the British option is to understand nothing about the one or the other, the horror of one and the horror of the other.

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,180
Since Quesnay, the liberals have always looked with envy at the Chinese Empire; and they still do.

86
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:12,180
They are Siamese twins. The fact that one of them confines you in its interest and the other in the interest of "society" always amounts to suppressing the only non nihilistic conduct:

87
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,080
taking care of oneself, of those one loves, and of what one loves in those one doesn't know.

88
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Don't let those who've lead you to the abyss claim to be saving you from it.

89
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:32,640
They will prepare you for a more perfect hell, an even deeper grave. And someday when they're able, they'll send the army to patrol the afterlife.

90
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,860
You ought to thank me rather. Without me, for how much longer would those unquestionable things that are suddenly suspended have gone on being presented as necessary.

91
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:48,800
Globalization, competitive exams, air traffic, budgetary limits, elections, sports spectacles, disneyland fitness gyms, most businesses,

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,300
the National Assembly, school, barracking, mass gatherings, most office jobs,

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,720
all that automatic sociability that is nothing but the reverse of the anxious solitude of the metropolitan monads:

94
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,180
all of that was rendered unnecessary once the state of necessity asserted its presence.

95
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,120
Thank me for the truth test in the coming weeks.

96
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,020
You're finally going to inhabit your own life, without the thousand escapes that, good year bad year, hold the untenable together.

97
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,860
Now you will live with your kindreds. You will be at home. You will cease to be in transit towards death.

98
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,340
Perhaps you will hate your husband. Maybe your children won't be able to stand you. Maybe you will feel like blowing up the decor of your everyday life.

99
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:38,000
The truth is that you were no longer in the world, in those metropolises of separation. Your world was no longer livable in any of its guises unless you were constantly cleaning.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,560
Thanks to me, for an indefinite time, you will no longer go to work, your kids won't go to school, and yet it will be the opposite of a vacation.

101
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,570
Vacations are that space that must be filled up at all costs while waiting for the obligatory return to work.

102
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,580
But now what is opening up in front of you, thanks to me, is not a delimited space but a gaping emptiness.

103
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,860
I render you idle.

104
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,780
There's no guarantee that yesterday's non-world will reappear. All of that profitable absurdity may cease.

105
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,400
Not being paid oneself, what would be more natural than to stop paying one's rent?

106
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,180
Why would a person unable to work go on depositing their mortgage payments at the bank?

107
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,320
Isn't it suicidal, when you come down to it, to live where you can't even cultivate a garden?

108
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,600
Someone who doesn't have any money left doesn't stop eating as a consequence, and who has the iron has the bread.

109
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,900
So thank me! I place you in front of the bifurcation that was tacitly structuring your existences: the economy or life.

110
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,260
It's your move, your turn to play. The stakes are historical.

111
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,100
Either the governing authorities impose their state of exception on you, or you invent your own.

112
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,620
Either you go with the truths that are coming to light, or you put your head on the chopping block.

113
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,080
Either you use the time I'm giving you to envision the world of the aftermath in light of what you learned from the collapse that's underway, or the latter will go extreme.

114
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,460
The disaster ends when the economy ends. The economy is the devastation.

115
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,640
That was a theory before last month, now it is a fact.

116
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,260
So as you deal with me,

117
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,650
don't succumb to panic or denial, don't give in to the biopolitical hysterias.

118
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,800
The coming weeks will be terrible, oppressive, and cruel. The gates of death will be wide open.

119
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,280
I am the most devastating production of the devastation of production.

120
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,220
I come to reduce the nihilists to nothingness. The injustice of this world will never be more outrageous.

121
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,740
It's a civilization, not you, that I come to bury.

122
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,380
Those who desire to live will have to construct new habits, ones that are suitable for them.

123
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,060
But avoiding me will be the occasion for this reinvention, this new art of distances.

124
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:45,680
The art of greeting one another, which some were short sighted enough to see as the very form of the institution, will soon not obey any etiquette.

125
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,580
It will sign beings.

126
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,740
Don't do it "for the others," for "the population," or for, "society." Do it for your people.

127
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:00,120
Take care of your friends, and those you love. Rethink along with them, decisively, would a just form of life would be.

128
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,160
Organize clusters of right living and expand them, and I won't be able to do anything against you.

129
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:14,120
I am calling for a massive return, not of discipline, but of attention. Not for the end of insouciance, but the end of all carelessness.

130
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,420
What other way remained for me to remind you that salvation is in each gesture.

131
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,480
That everything is the tiniest thing.

132
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,360
I've had to face the facts: humanity only asks itself the questions it can no longer keep from asking.

133
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,000
So for what it's worth, this is a link. That was the poem. Thank you so much for listening for that.

134
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,620
This is a link to some resources from the Anarcho-Tech NYC collective about some social distancing resources, please use them, share them,

135
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,080
consider supporting those five demands for emergency COVID-19 survival in your state.

136
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,460
There's plenty of petitions you can find them on the internet.

137
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,580
And that, thank you again, was my little "I'm worried about my family. I hope everyone's okay."
