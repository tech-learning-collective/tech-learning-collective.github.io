00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.060
So, there's this discussion, right, in hopefully episode one about

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.880
putting Colby's IP in the dat file, right?

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.980
So, a "dat file" is just hacker speak for a file with an extension of .dat.

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.300
I make a text file, right? So let's say this is some text.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.480
And I put this into, you know, a file with a dot txt extension, right?

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If I use the file command on that file, you'll see that it says to me that I had ASCII text, right?

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120
So it tells me that I have a text file.

8
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.320
A dat file is simply a file with aâ€”I'll move that to a dot dat extension, right? So we're taking text,

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.520
and we're changing it out with dot dat.

10
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.360
And the idea here is that technically a dat file, that's all it is. It's just a file with a dot dat extension.

11
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.800
But if I put some, for example, some binary data in it, so let's do for example,

12
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.400
openssl, some random bytes and put that into openssl rand,

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.420
let's say 10 bytes of random data. And if we xxd that, xxd file with a .dat.

14
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.000
So, here's some random bytes that I generated. This is no longer text.

15
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.180
It's just, you know, ones and zeros, basically. And here we can see the hex dump of it.

16
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.280
So now we have a dat file, which is just a data file, right short for data.

17
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.260
And that's all that jargon is.

18
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.320
We don't know exactly what rootkit Darlene was like,

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.960
Darlene was writing there, and we don't know exactly what the architecture of their sort of scheme

20
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.560
against the Evil Corp really was.

21
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.440
One possible guess, right, is to assume that if you are the FBI, trying to sort of figure out who did what,

22
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.640
then one of the things are going to do, is you're going to grab some evidence from the machines that you are investigating.

23
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:10.800
So for example, if we go to awesome incident response, wiki infosec, incident, awesome incident response.

24
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.260
So here is a repo on GitHub with a ton of tools for evidence collection,

25
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.940
Margarita Shotgun, it's a pretty popular one down here.

26
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.940
And so evidence collection in the context of DFIR (digital forensics and incident response) is

27
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.180
the collection of digital artifacts from potentially compromised or just sort of like machines that you have on the network that you're trying to investigate

28
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.500
and figuring out what it is that they were doing at the time that matters to you.

29
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.100
It's basically the digital equivalent of detective sleuthing right.

30
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:52.040
And so putting an IP in a dat file we are to left to assume means that there's some file somewhere

31
00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:03.380
that their programming, you know, their rootkit, their hack against Evil Corp was tracing the locations of connecting computers.

32
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.620
And if you find an IP and again, an IP is going to be something like for example, right?

33
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.040
Right. So here's some example IPs, these are all sort of my

34
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.140
local network IP, you can see that you probably also have like a 192.168.10, or 192.168.1 or 192.168.200 or something like that

35
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.560
network wherever you are.

36
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.840
And so these are IP addresses, as we may already know,

37
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.680
and putting an IP in a dat file probably means something along the lines of

38
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.020
faking some evidence that would then be collected from tools like these

39
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.900
by a digital forensics and incident response group

40
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:53.200
that would then point to quote "Colby's terminal," by which they mean the computer that Colby uses in his office.
