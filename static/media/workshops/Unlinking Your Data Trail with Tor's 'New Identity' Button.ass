Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.94,0:00:09.52,Default,,0,0,0,,This is sort of where the like, it's good to know how the tool works so that you can use it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.52,0:00:11.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So you understand what it's doing.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.24,0:00:18.48,Default,,0,0,0,,But it is also just as important for you to know how to use the tool, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.48,0:00:24.44,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not important thatâ€”you need to both know how to use it safely and what it is doing.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.48,0:00:25.44,Default,,0,0,0,,How it works.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.80,0:00:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Only knowing one of them right doesn't cover you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.68,0:00:34.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Knowing how it works might have you be very knowledgeable about sort of the technical side,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.26,0:00:39.66,Default,,0,0,0,,but not knowing how to use it safely means that your OPSEC, your operational security,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.86,0:00:41.24,Default,,0,0,0,,could be compromised.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.24,0:00:44.86,Default,,0,0,0,,And what I mean by that is simply the things you do your operations,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.26,0:00:50.54,Default,,0,0,0,,right, could be compromised simply by stuff you do that the technology is not designed or not equipped to protect you against.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.82,0:00:52.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So if I go to facebook.com and I log in here,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.28,0:00:57.54,Default,,0,0,0,,right let's say I'm you know, Shayla and I suddenly, nah, let's say I'm Sam Elliot cuz Shayla doesn't use,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.54,0:00:59.54,Default,,0,0,0,,nah, let's use Shayla,  'cause let's make her awesome.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:03.02,Default,,0,0,0,,shayla@mac.com right, can I type in my password here?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.02,0:01:06.36,Default,,0,0,0,,If I were to log in? This is not obviously a real Facebook account. But if it was,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.96,0:01:11.90,Default,,0,0,0,,you know, what would be happening here? Why would this potentially compromise
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.90,0:01:14.30,Default,,0,0,0,,my Tor connection to at least Facebook?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.30,0:01:21.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, Facebook does have an onion site. In fact, let's go there facebookcorewwwi.onion.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.90,0:01:29.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, so Razi says whoever owns the end node gets your creds.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.44,0:01:31.44,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not so much about the end node in this case, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.76,0:01:37.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Because, theoretically, especially with the Facebook, onion service, right,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.44,0:01:40.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and also the HTTPS connection that we're making to,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.20,0:01:46.64,Default,,0,0,0,,to Facebook right, the end node here. Well, I guess now we're on the onion site. Let's go back.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.04,0:01:54.26,Default,,0,0,0,,The exit node right is not going to know our creds because we are still HTTPS encrypted, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.26,0:01:59.68,Default,,0,0,0,,We have that little lock icon we can see that it's, the actual certificate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.00,0:02:03.56,Default,,0,0,0,,by Facebook so if I actually inspect the certificate super closely,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.56,0:02:08.78,Default,,0,0,0,,you can see that the SHA 256 fingerprint here is going to match Facebook's.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.78,0:02:13.44,Default,,0,0,0,,But in any event, the point is that if it's encrypted, then the exit node isn't going to know your creds,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.62,0:02:17.52,Default,,0,0,0,,the site you're going to log into, it's going to know your creds, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.52,0:02:21.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And the point here is that Facebook has like fucking bugs everywhere, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.16,0:02:24.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, I mean, what sites do you go to that doesn't have a Facebook like icon.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.32,0:02:31.94,Default,,0,0,0,,And so if you're now browsing around to different sites, Tor browser will try to do some things to protect you in that scenario, it's called circuit isolation.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.94,0:02:36.60,Default,,0,0,0,,But you know, because Facebook is sort of has one of these that really
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.60,0:02:41.24,Default,,0,0,0,,wide reaching you know, there weren't there you can basically think of them as like the Internet Five Eyes, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.24,0:02:47.46,Default,,0,0,0,,The Five Eyes are like those nation states that have come together, the United States, England, I think Australia,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.46,0:02:50.66,Default,,0,0,0,,there's a couple of others but the point is like Facebook is basically like a five eye,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.66,0:02:54.46,Default,,0,0,0,,right like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, the FAANG, you know,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.46,0:02:59.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google thing. Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.08,0:03:05.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Those companies have like web bugs basically fucking everywhere on every fucking website.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.08,0:03:12.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And so if you go to a bunch of different sites, after logging into Facebook on Tor Browser, then it is possible
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.44,0:03:18.34,Default,,0,0,0,,through traffic correlation for Facebook to potentially start to get some profile of you, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.34,0:03:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,And so it's not bad to log into Facebook, feel free to do that over Tor Browser.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.08,0:03:33.46,Default,,0,0,0,,But it's not necessarily something you want to then immediately start doing like stuff that you would maybe not want to search like, you know,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.46,0:03:36.24,Default,,0,0,0,,you know, I'm not gonna do that right now, but
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.64,0:03:39.20,Default,,0,0,0,,in the same tab, or in the same session.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.20,0:03:43.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And so in between those two things, you want to click this button, the New Identity button,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.22,0:03:47.30,Default,,0,0,0,,and that'll sort of wipe your Tor browser history in a certain way, give you a new circuit etc.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.30,0:03:48.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's what this is for.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.22,0:03:52.30,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is for unlinking your previous activity to your future activity.
