Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.48,0:00:07.06,Default,,0,0,0,,So, there's this discussion, right, in hopefully episode one about
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.06,0:00:10.88,Default,,0,0,0,,putting Colby's IP in the dat file, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.88,0:00:15.98,Default,,0,0,0,,So, a "dat file" is just hacker speak for a file with an extension of .dat.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.98,0:00:20.30,Default,,0,0,0,,I make a text file, right? So let's say this is some text.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.52,0:00:26.48,Default,,0,0,0,,And I put this into, you know, a file with a dot txt extension, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.00,0:00:33.00,Default,,0,0,0,,If I use the file command on that file, you'll see that it says to me that I had ASCII text, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.00,0:00:35.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So it tells me that I have a text file.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.12,0:00:44.32,Default,,0,0,0,,A dat file is simply a file with a—I'll move that to a dot dat extension, right? So we're taking text,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.32,0:00:46.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and we're changing it out with dot dat.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.52,0:00:52.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And the idea here is that technically a dat file, that's all it is. It's just a file with a dot dat extension.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.36,0:00:55.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But if I put some, for example, some binary data in it, so let's do for example,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.80,0:01:02.40,Default,,0,0,0,,openssl, some random bytes and put that into openssl rand,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.80,0:01:11.42,Default,,0,0,0,,let's say 10 bytes of random data. And if we xxd that, xxd file with a .dat.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.42,0:01:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So, here's some random bytes that I generated. This is no longer text.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.60,0:01:19.18,Default,,0,0,0,,It's just, you know, ones and zeros, basically. And here we can see the hex dump of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.44,0:01:24.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So now we have a dat file, which is just a data file, right short for data.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.28,0:01:27.26,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's all that jargon is.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.80,0:01:31.32,Default,,0,0,0,,We don't know exactly what rootkit Darlene was like,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.00,0:01:38.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Darlene was writing there, and we don't know exactly what the architecture of their sort of scheme
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.96,0:01:40.56,Default,,0,0,0,,against the Evil Corp really was.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.56,0:01:49.44,Default,,0,0,0,,One possible guess, right, is to assume that if you are the FBI, trying to sort of figure out who did what,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.44,0:01:56.64,Default,,0,0,0,,then one of the things are going to do, is you're going to grab some evidence from the machines that you are investigating.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.64,0:02:10.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So for example, if we go to awesome incident response, wiki infosec, incident, awesome incident response.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.80,0:02:15.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So here is a repo on GitHub with a ton of tools for evidence collection,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.26,0:02:18.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Margarita Shotgun, it's a pretty popular one down here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.94,0:02:26.94,Default,,0,0,0,,And so evidence collection in the context of DFIR (digital forensics and incident response) is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.94,0:02:36.18,Default,,0,0,0,,the collection of digital artifacts from potentially compromised or just sort of like machines that you have on the network that you're trying to investigate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.34,0:02:40.50,Default,,0,0,0,,and figuring out what it is that they were doing at the time that matters to you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.50,0:02:44.10,Default,,0,0,0,,It's basically the digital equivalent of detective sleuthing right.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.10,0:02:52.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And so putting an IP in a dat file we are to left to assume means that there's some file somewhere
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.04,0:03:03.38,Default,,0,0,0,,that their programming, you know, their rootkit, their hack against Evil Corp was tracing the locations of connecting computers.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.38,0:03:09.62,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you find an IP and again, an IP is going to be something like for example, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.10,0:03:16.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Right. So here's some example IPs, these are all sort of my
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.04,0:03:24.14,Default,,0,0,0,,local network IP, you can see that you probably also have like a 192.168.10, or 192.168.1 or 192.168.200 or something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.14,0:03:25.56,Default,,0,0,0,,network wherever you are.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.56,0:03:29.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And so these are IP addresses, as we may already know,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.84,0:03:34.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and putting an IP in a dat file probably means something along the lines of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.68,0:03:40.02,Default,,0,0,0,,faking some evidence that would then be collected from tools like these
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.84,0:03:43.90,Default,,0,0,0,,by a digital forensics and incident response group
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.90,0:03:53.20,Default,,0,0,0,,that would then point to quote "Colby's terminal," by which they mean the computer that Colby uses in his office.
