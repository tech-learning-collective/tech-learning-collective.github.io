title: Free, Foundational Self-Paced Computer Practice Labs
columns: 1
---

Tech Learning Collective provides numerous free, self-paced practice labs that you can use to jump-start your learning before you ever join us at one of [our events]({% link events/index.md %}).

These labs are provided free of charge, and are always available, so feel free to take as long as you need to work through them. Our &ldquo;Foundations&rdquo; series of courses are designed to introduce you to the most important foundations of our material. We also offer several bite-sized modules of additional [sample learning modules](#sample-learning-modules) to show you some of what our longer in-person and online webinar workshops are like.

Of course, nothing can compare to learning directly from a teacher whom you can actually see and ask questions of in real time, but we hope that these self-paced learning modules will whet your appetite until your next (or first) class with us!

## Sample Learning Modules

These sample modules provide a peek at some of what you&rsquo;ll learn in our more in-depth, instructor-led [training workshops]({% link workshops/index.md %}) or [intensive courses]({% link courses/index.md %}).
