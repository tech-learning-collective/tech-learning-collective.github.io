title: Free, Foundational Self-Paced Practice Labs
columns: 1

Tech Learning Collective provides some free, self-paced practice labs that you can use to jump-start your learing before you even join us at one of [our events]({% link events/index.md %}). These labs are provided free of charge and are designed to introduce you to the most important foundations of our material. They also serve as a bite-sized sampling to show you what our longer in-person and online webinar workshops are like. Of course, nothing can compare to learning directly from a teacher whom you can actually see and ask questions of in real time, but we hope that these self-paced learning modules will whet your appetite until your next (or first) class with us!
