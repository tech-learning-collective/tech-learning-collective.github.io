# Collections.
#
# Collections are a Jekyll feature that takes structured data and can
# render a page for each item in that data structure. For example, you
# can make a collection of baking recipes and then, for each recipe in
# the collection, you can make a page with its own Web address to show
# the recipe on your Web site.
