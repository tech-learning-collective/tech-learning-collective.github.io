The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the *language* that it actually is? What is HTML's grammar, where do HTML "sentences" begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don't need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.

This workshop is designed for anyone who ever toyed with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90's or just last week. Based on a portion of the [Tech Learning Collective's WEB101 course]({% link _courses/web101.md %}), it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web's most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa, learn how to write in the Web's native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly *understand* what you're saying.
