Some of the most sensitive information that activist groups must manage is the identities of the people involved. This is one reason why using pseudonyms, nicknames, or code names has long been a low-tech method of obscuring some of this information from adversaries who might be eavesdropping. Another vitally important kind of information for any organizing group is where and when certain things are happening. To make things more complicated, both of these classes of information often need to be shared, as they form the foundation of organizing tools such as mailing lists and events.

Even if you're not doing anything secretive—maybe you're just running a small community news room—contacts and calendars are often at the center of activity. So, once an organization has [their own server]({% link _workshops/Radical Infrastructure: Your First Physical Server.md %}), a common next step is to provide a place to share contact and calendar information that (isn't also immediately shared with the Googles and Facebooks of the world) in order to take advantage of all the benefits that digital versions of these tools provide.

In this workshop, we'll take a deep-dive into self-hosted contacts and calendaring applications. You'll learn about vCards and <code>.ics</code> files, and the CardDAV and CalDAV protocols, which are all freely available file formats and networking standards, the very same formats and standards that tools like Google Calendar are built on. Instead of Google Calednar, though, we'll use [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) CardDAV and CalDAV servers running on our own servers to demonstrate the advantages of self-hosting your own services and truly owning your own data.
