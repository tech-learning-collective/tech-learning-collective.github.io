Every app you use&mdash;from messengers like [Signal](https://signal.org/) or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and [online maps](https://openstreetmap.org/)&mdash;relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (&ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where *your* servers are? If not, you can&rsquo;t know how safe your data is!

Often, the first step in effective radical organizing is escaping from the surveillance economy by using alternatives to popular online services such as Google's GMail for email and Facebook's Messenger for instant messaging. But in order to truly do that, you have to go beyond merely jumping ship to another company's services by running your own version of that service, a process called self-hosting. And to truly do *that* safely, you have to have a computer that can function like those services, which means you need your own servers.

Thankfully, unless your activist group has millions of people in it, most consumer hardware can function remarkably well as servers. The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), a palm-sized single board computer that retails for $35 USD and is sold without a screen or a keyboard, is one great example of such a device that even poorer advocacy groups can use as astonishingly powerful servers with the right know-how. This means that most small- to mid-sized organizations of a dozen to several hundred people can have their own truly self-owned and self-operated server infrastructures, completely independent from the Googles and Facebooks of the world, for only a few dozen dollars.

In this workshop, you'll walk through the first steps of setting up a physical server, installing a GNU/Linux Operating System, and configuring the device for remote administrative access via the SSH protocol. Much like learning to stretch a canvas makes it possible for you to paint any painting you like, getting good at these steps will make it possible for you to operate your own fleet of devices to do, well, anything and everything a computer can do. By the end of this workshop, you'll be ready to install additional services so that you can start putting digital technologies to work for your organization.
