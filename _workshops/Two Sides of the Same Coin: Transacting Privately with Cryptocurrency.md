title: "Two Sides of the Same Coin: Transacting Privately with Cryptocurrency"
simple_description: >
  Bitcoin changed the world when it was formally released in 2009. But its promise of financial independence, free from control of centralized banks and economic surveillance by governments, has not fully materialized. This workshop is for anyone who wants to understand the foundational technologies of cryptocurrency enough to be able to confidently transact using them, but will also debunk common myths around their security and privacy by practicing with newer cryptocurrencies called "privacy coins," like Monero and Zcash, that shield transaction data from prying eyes. You'll learn how authorities "follow the money" when it's on a blockchain, and practice how to use wallets, make cross-chain swaps, and retain your privacy so that you can use cryptocurrency as it was always intended: just like cash.
