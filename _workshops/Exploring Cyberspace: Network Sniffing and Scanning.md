Have you ever wondered what&rsquo;s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we&rsquo;ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us&mdash;or not!

These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments&mdash;our messages&mdash;as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they&rsquo;ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they&rsquo;ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) along with digital wiretapping tools like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.

Join us for a two-hour mission: to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!
