# Tech Learning Collective - Public Website

This repository contains the public Web site for the Tech Learning Collective, which you can visit at [https://TechLearningCollective.com](https://TechLearningCollective.com/). It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a popular [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator) and, as of this writing, is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Since it is specific to the needs of the Tech Learning Collective, the code contained here is unlikely to be of immediate use to the general public.

Nevertheless, it does contain numerous features that makes it a useful example in numerous parts of the [Tech Learning Collective's Web Development and Design courses](https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/web/). Among these are:

* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) conformant HTML5 Microdata attributes along with `h-card`, `adr`, and `h-event` [Microformats](http://microformats.org/) in various parts of the HTML template.
* [CSS3 Flexbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) and [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) layout design elements.
* [iCalendar feed layout](_layouts/iCalendar.ics) (based on data from a [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)) compatible with [RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) conformant parsers.

## About the Tech Learning Collective

The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals. In particular, we offer education to select students who are primarily interested in community-based, grassroots, and activist spheres. Where most existing coding bootcamps, technical trade schools, and development academies focus on guiding the highest number of students possible through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training for batches of politically engaged and self-motivated students.
