The [Tor workshop [I attended]]({% link _workshops/Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!).md %}) was very slow, considered, and thorough, providing hours of spacious learning and the space to fully comprehend and learn. Although I did write down notes, I doubt I&rsquo;ll need to refer to them, because of the pacing and thoroughness of understanding each step.

Rather than cramming too much information to retain, the tutor respectfully provided the core information repetitively, from multiple nuanced perspectives. That way, it&rsquo;s gone in, I have done the learning while in the workshop, as opposed to needing to reread notes after the fact, and try to make sense of the information.

It was inclusive and respectful, and even the platform kinda helps with that, which gives you a screen of an avatar, and the option to collaborate either with your mic for voices, or by typing in the chat box.

Thanks again, TLC! I feel empowered to do this now!
