The workshop I most recently attended, [File Sharing for Fun and Profit]({% link _workshops/File Sharing for Fun and Profit: How BitTorrent Works and What You Can Do With It.md %}), was extremely well organized and was a great presentation demonstrating the ease of using BitTorrent as well as its benefits. Better still, since the instructor at every TLC workshop I've attended so far mentions resources that I probably wouldn't have learned as much about in other ways, I'm often able to double the number of valuable resources I get from attending the workshop by entering the names of things I learn about from the workshop into the search box of several search engines.

It's clear that TLC's instructors possess a deep reservoir of knowledge about BitTorrent and the other subjects in their curriculum.  I'd encourage anyone wishing to learn more about BitTorrent, [Tor]({% link _workshops/Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!).md %}), [PGP]({% link _workshops/Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail.md %}), [Signal]({% link _workshops/Signal and Surveillance: How to Exercise Digital Civil Liberties in a Surveillance State.md %}), etcetera, to [enroll]({% link enrollment/index.md %}) in a TLC workshop or course in order to get the opportunity to draw from this rich reservoir!
