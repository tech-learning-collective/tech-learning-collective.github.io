The [Practical Digital Security]({% link _workshops/Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security.md %}) workshop \[I attended] was immensely helpful. It provided me with a sense of calm, explained different levels of threat, and left me with tools that I could use in everyday life. The class not only helped me as an individual, but in ways I could share with my work, friends, and family. The teaching style was informative and engaging. It was a very well-spent Saturday!
