The amount I&rsquo;m learning in Tech Learning Collective workshops is way more than what I was learning in my college classroom. As a computer science major, most of the curriculum was all about theory and had very little practical work. TLC more than fills in that gap for me. Another reason I&rsquo;m frequenting TLC events is for their community! I would&rsquo;ve never known how vibrant TLC&rsquo;s alternative tech community was. I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to participating in as many Tech Learning Collective events and courses as possible.
