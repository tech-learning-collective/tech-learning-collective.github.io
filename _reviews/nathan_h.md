I have been to several of TLC&rsquo;s workshops, on [networks]({% link _workshops/Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work.md %}), [`git`]({% link _workshops/Collaboration Across Universes: Basics of Version Control with Git.md %}), [Signal]({% link _workshops/Signal and Surveillance: How to Exercise Digital Civil Liberties in a Surveillance State.md %}), and [virtual machines]({% link _workshops/The Imitation Game: Introduction to Administering Virtual Machine Systems.md %}), as well as their [Hackers Next Door]({% post_url 2019-11-01-press-release-hackers-next-door-2019 %}) conference and a [Mr. Robot-themed happy hour event]({% post_url 2020-04-02-mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights %}). I also loved their online [Foundations]({% link foundations/index.md %}) courses. I have found the instructors to be extraordinarily knowledgeable on an extremely wide variety of topics. They are fluent in this stuff, plain and simple, and quite good at explaining dense, complicated topics. As someone who is new to the &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; of today&rsquo;s technologies, I feel that I have benefited greatly from their events. After each workshop, I have numerous takeaways that help me continue to learn on my own time, but I keep coming back to their live workshops because of the quality of the instruction. I cannot overemphasize how highly I recommend Tech Learning Collective.
