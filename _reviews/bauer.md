As a Data Scientist coming from statistics instead of computer science, Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s [NET101 course]({% link _courses/net101.md %}) and their [Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work]({% link _workshops/Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work.md %}) workshop helped demystify how computers are set up and talk to one another. The concepts were broken down into easy to digest bite sized pieces allowing the unfamiliar language to become new and accessible vocabulary, which upon reflection seemed to be the biggest hurdle in my understanding. Thanks so much!
