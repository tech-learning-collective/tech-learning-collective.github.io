The instructor was great. They made the workshop [I attended] a positive and open learning environment, offered clear explanations, useful graphics, and resources to put the subject into understandable context, and was super generous with their time and personable in fielding the range of questions. What a great resource TLC is! I look forward to my next workshop.
