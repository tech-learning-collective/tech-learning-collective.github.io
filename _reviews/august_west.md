I found Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s &ldquo;[Our Streets, Our Maps]({% link _workshops/Our Streets, Our Maps: Introduction to OpenStreetMap.md %})&rdquo; was a highly informative and stimulating workshop. The instructor did an excellent job illustrating the great versatility of OpenStreetMap and demonstrating the wide range of queries it can satisfy. As someone who&rsquo;d never before used OpenStreetMap, this workshop captured my imagination and has inspired me to plumb the depths of this valuable resource!
