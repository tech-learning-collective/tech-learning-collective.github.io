When I attended [Tech Learning Collective's "Securing Email" PGP workshop]({% link _workshops/Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail.md %}), I was expecting more of a simple how-to, but the instructor was detailed and informative, and went deeper to show us what encryption really is, how keys work, and where to find more information. The workshop was thorough but unintimidating and the instructor did a good job of checking the groupâ€™s temperature and staying in tune with our respective paces of learning and skill set. Also I *really* appreciate the femme-friendly communications and price structure.
