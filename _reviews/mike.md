I really enjoyed the [Clearing Away the Clouds]({% link _workshops/Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work.md %}) class on networking. I know only a tiny bit about networking but am trying to learn more to be a responsible and safe digital citizen. This class was just the right combination of informative and challenging. The instructutor definitely dove into some really complicated ideas but always took the time to go back and make sure that we understood.
