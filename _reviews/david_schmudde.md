Teaching a technical class from the terminal is a difficult proposition when you have students coming in from all over the world. The instructor of &ldquo;[Exploring Cyberspace: Network Sniffing and Scanning]({% link _workshops/Exploring Cyberspace: Network Sniffing and Scanning.md %})&rdquo; did a commendable job getting a sense of the (virtual) room and talking at our level. Their task is probably helped by the fact that the Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s course offerings have titles and a mission that engage curious minds.

Before taking the class, I had some passing experience with one or two of the tools the instructor introduced. I would have considered myself a beginner. The instructor managed to take us into deep waters by illustrating small steps, making sure we understood the fundamental terminology, and asking us lots of questions. The scope of the class was thoughtfully limited&mdash;enough to make sure we could swim but also realize there is much more to learn. Quite an accomplishment in under two hours!
