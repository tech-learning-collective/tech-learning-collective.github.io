I found Tech Learning Collective recently through [their membership in the Electronic Frontier Alliance]({% link _posts/2019-08-13-joining-the-electronic-frontier-alliance.md %}) and jumped right in to many of their great learning opportunities. The [System Administration and Operation Basics workshop]({% link _workshops/Taming Daemons: System Administration and Operation Basics.md %}) is a great example. The instruction was very thorough and responsive to where students are in the tech learning process. After the session I now feel like I have a strong foundation of understanding that I can build upon in setting up tech for my business. 

I&rsquo;m excited to continue learning with the Tech Learning Collective team and recommend them to anyone seeking to understand the complex tech world we live in every day.
