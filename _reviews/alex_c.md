I knew that I have a lot to learn about digital security and online privacy, but I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what I had to learn, or how to start. After I took Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s [Signal and Surveillance workshop]({% link _workshops/Signal and Surveillance: How to Exercise Digital Civil Liberties in a Surveillance State.md %}), though, the things I didn&rsquo;t know that I didn&rsquo;t know became a lot clearer. At the same time, the workshop got me jazzed to take other courses from them. It was simply so illuminating!
