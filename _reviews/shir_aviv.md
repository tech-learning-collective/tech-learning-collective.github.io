Outstanding webinar taught by a phenomenal instructor! [My TLC instructor] was not only a wealth of knowledge, but was also engaging, patient, and knew how to explain even the most complex concepts in a way that everyone can understand. As a software teacher myself, I always appreciate high-quality instruction that not only educates, but also does so in a fun, and efficient manner. I can safely say that I have learned more about computers in the single Tech Learning Collective &ldquo;[Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security]({% link _workshops/Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security.md %})&rdquo; workshop I attended than I have in four years of college. I cannot recommend the Tech Learning Collective highly enough!
