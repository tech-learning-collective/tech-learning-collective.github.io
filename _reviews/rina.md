I joined [Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s &ldquo;Practical Digital Security&rdquo; workshop]({% link _workshops/Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security.md %}) because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.

It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how &ldquo;doxing&rdquo; happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.

But there was so much more, too. I&rsquo;m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.
