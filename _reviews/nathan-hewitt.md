In unpredictable times, we need to keep each other safe. To do so, you donâ€™t need to be a tech whiz or fluent coder. Plenty of volunteer developers have already made tools and applications to help you and your team increase safety and privacy without sacrificing functionality.

[Tech Learning Collective is] an amazing educational organization that can teach you all about online security. I owe much of this guide to what I have learned from them and the personal research their work has inspired. TLC has recently started to do more webinars ([event calendar]({% link events/index.md %})), so their work is now accessible from anywhere!
