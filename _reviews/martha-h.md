[A]fter checking the\[ir [Gone Phishing]({% link _workshops/Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams.md %}) workshop] out, I highly recommend!! I’ve gone to a lot of meetups, including a few cybersecurity workshops, and what they are doing is really top of the line. The workshop was a good middle ground of welcoming for beginners, but still engaging for more experienced people. I learned so much! It was well-paced and had a tight, manageable scope, but I also walked away with a ton of links of additional resources to explore on my own time. So if you’re in the NYC area and have the chance, definitely check out [their calendar]({% link events/index.md %})!
