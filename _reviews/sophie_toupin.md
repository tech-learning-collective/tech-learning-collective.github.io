During the anti-globalization movement of the early 2000s, tech collectives such as [Riseup](https://riseup.net/) and [Autistici](https://www.autistici.org/) came into existence to provide autonomous, non-corporate communication tools and “How-Tos” for social movements to organize safely and securely with emerging new media. In South Africa, the [Right2Know](https://www.r2k.org.za/) campaign was initiated in 2010 in response to the Protection of State Information Bill, which aimed at weakening the rights of journalists and whistleblowers to access information. As part of their work, R2K has published [guides for activists](https://www.r2k.org.za/2020/09/01/digitalsecurity/) to protect themselves digitally.

To heighten my own digital defense practice, I recently took a virtual workshop offered by the New York-based [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/). This collective provides technology education for radical organizers and revolutionary communities with special attention to underserved groups. These groups, which design tools and training for activists, are not a new occurrence.
