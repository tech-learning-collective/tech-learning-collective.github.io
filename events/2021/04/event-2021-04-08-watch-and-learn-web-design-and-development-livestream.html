        <div class="p-description description">
            <p>Ever wanted to peek over the shoulder of an expert developer as they write code, to pick their brain while they solve real-life problems in real time, or simply bask in the comfort of watching an experienced craftsperson at work? Tech Learning Collective’s “Watch and Learn” events are your chance to join our staff as they livestream some of the work they do, such as redesigning our Web site, building out new or upgrading old infrastructure, and performing other (non-sensitive) tasks to keep Tech Learning Collective moving forward. It’s like watching Bob Ross paint, if he were painting with bits and bytes.</p>

<h2 id="livestream-topic">Livestream Topic</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tech Learning Collective is redesigning our Web site for 2021. In a few months, we’ll launch a brand new custom Web design for our public-facing Web site. We’ll have new colors, new layouts, and most importantly new code. So this Watch and Learn event will be focused almost exclusively on front-end Web development.</p>

  <p>Some of the work has already been done, but there’s lots more to do. Our Web designer will be streaming the way they start by examining graphic design artifacts from the Free Software <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</a>, a powerful alternative to Adobe Photoshop, translating them into liquid and dynamic layouts so that they work in a variety of Web browser makes, models, and sizes, and finally how they integrate the new code with our Web site’s simple Content Management System (CMS) called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Along the way, you’ll get to see how an experienced front-end Web designer thinks about design elements like layout grids, how they organize and optimize Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code, and how rich metadata in the form of semantic HTML markup makes their job easier.</p>

  <p>By attending, you get a front-row seat to the video livestream, along with access to a chat channel where you can ask questions about and offer feedback on the coding process live and in real time. We recommend that you have at least some familiarity with basic HTML and CSS code, as this is not a full-fledged class or workshop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href="#tickets-event-2021-04-08-watch-and-learn-web-design-and-development-livestream">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="/faq/#workshops-and-webinars">our workshops and webinars FAQ</a> for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.</p>

<p>As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior <em>will</em> result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules">our lightweight social rules</a> for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.</p>
