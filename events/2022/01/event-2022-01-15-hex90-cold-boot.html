FM HEX90
TO QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD

COLD BOOT (SECRET//NOFORN)

HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in nyc

The most powerful magic of all is the power of language.

Perhaps you are still becoming aware of yourself as a magician. Perhaps you can already code, but don't feel connected to the vibrating silicon enchanting your every keypress when you inscribe your intentions as spell-craft into your computer. Perhaps you don't yet know how to write the proper incantations, but already feel strangely drawn to the arcane sigils and symbols animating the metal and electric fires in your machine.

We are witches, wizards, and techno-sorceresses. The shape shifters, the body-changers, the tele-mindful whose technology is humanity and connection itself. We were the original programmers, the first hackers. And now, we are returning.

<h2 id="about-shift-ctrl-space">About <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a></h2>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

<h2 id="about-livecodenyc">About <a href="https://livecode.nyc/">LiveCode.NYC</a></h2>

<p>We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p>
