Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to <a href=""https://hex90.party/"">Hex90’s latest queer hacker salon, “Transposition,”</a> hosted at <a href=""https://wonderville.nyc/"">Wonderville, where you can buy tickets</a>.</p><pre style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><code class=""language-txt"">DHRRE UNPXREF BS GUR JBEYQ, HAVGR!HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYCChange has come again. It arrives streaming on the airwaves, in the storms, over the wires. Some fear it, others welcome it, but few deny it. Change transports us from where we were to where we must next be. It is not inevitable, for we are the change. They will fight for stagnation, but we will not be stopped.Transitions make us powerful. Transformation showed us difference, gave us perspective, and taught us adaptability. We have learned to reconfigure the world through command injection, and to reconfigure ourselves through hormonal injections. To hackers, these are the same: when we reconfigure ourselves, we reconfigure the world. When we reconfigure the world, we reconfigure ourselves.Transpose this and that. Redefine the problem. Substitute the premise. Shift bits left. Cycle one round at a time. Repeat for block after block. Again. Faster. FASTER. Continue until nothing is the same, and beautiful differences are all that remain of the source.This night, we celebrate transposition, the oldest witchcraft.GUVF AVTUG, JR PRYROENGR GENAFCBFVGVBA, GUR BYQRFG JVGPUPENSG.info_December 3, 2022 @ Wonderville1186 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 112218:00pm — 4:00am~ this venue is accessible~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms~ this venue has outdoor space# dressing up is encouraged but not requiredfeaturing_~ music performances by~~ Sailor Malice~~ ÆON~~ trans kafka~~ heaven ender~ livecoded visuals by~~ gwenpri.me~~ Janie Jaffe~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade~ hacking demos &amp; education by Tech Learning Collective~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL SpaceDANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops.

Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p><h2 id=""about-gwenprime"">About <a href=""https://gwenpri.me/"">gwenpri.me</a></h2><p>gwenpri.me is a creative technologist, artist, and livecoder.
