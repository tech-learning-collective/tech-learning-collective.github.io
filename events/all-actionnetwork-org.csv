"Hex90: Birthday Attack","Hex90: Birthday Attack (at Wonderville on July  8, 2023)","Wonderville","1186 Broadway","Brooklyn","NY","11221","","19:30","07/08/23","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Queer hackers of the world, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to a very special Hex90 party. Our <a href=""https://hex90.party/"">series of queer hacker salons in New York City, Hex90</a>, continues this Summer with <cite>Hex90: Birthday Attack</cite>, so named because we are simultaneously celebrating the birthdays/tranniversaries of several prominent community members. Join us at our favorite indie arcade venue, <a href=""https://wonderville.nyc/"">Wonderville</a>, for a celebration of trans and non-binary joy, gender affirmation, and the zest for life! Get ready for nostalgic favorites, retro tech, psychedelic, euphoric optimism, and of course prepare to hack the planet!</p><pre style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><code class=""language-txt"">HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYCWelcome, witches, wizards, and techno-sorceresses, to our next genesis! The process of becoming is both a moment and a series of discoveries. How much can one change before our new signature no longer matches the old? What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life.The 1980s was a decade of great technological change. The development of the modern Internet began with the ARPANET. Arcade games became a major industry. Personal computers experienced exponential growth. Boomboxes and the Walkman transformed music culture. Drum machines and electronic instruments dominated the music production landscape. And, let's not forget, epic synthesizers.The 1990s brought major social upheaval. Many Detroit-based artists propelled techno and house music onto the global stage. Tactics of ""digital civil disobedience"" pioneered by the Electronic Disturbance Theater captured the imagination of young hacktivists. The Matrix and Transgender Day of Remembrance began in the same year, sewing the seeds of revolutions still to come.You have to let it all go: fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind! Everything, everything, everything! I'm invisible. How deep does the rabbit hole go? Collide, and find your looking-glass self!info_July 8, 2023 @ Wonderville1186 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 112217:30pm — 4:00am~ this venue is accessible~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms~ this venue has outdoor space~ this venue permits entry only to those aged 21+# dressing up is encouraged but not requiredfeaturing_~ music performances by~~ Janus Rose~~ heaven ender~~ Niyah West~~ DJ Softserve~~ stuttersprite~~ dis_aster_ous~~ David Lunch~~ GENDERLESSBEAST~ visuals and livecoding by~~ gwenpri.me~~ alsoknownasrox~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade~ hacking demos &amp; education by Tech Learning Collective~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL SpaceDANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops.
