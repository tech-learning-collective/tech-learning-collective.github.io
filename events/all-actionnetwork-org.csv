In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective‚Äôs cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted ‚Äúthe Dark Web‚Äù as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and ‚Äúhidden services‚Äù work and you‚Äôll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective‚Äôs cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They‚Äôll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you‚Äôll finally understand‚Äîon a technical level‚Äîwhat the ‚ÄúDark Web‚Äù actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you‚Äôll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you‚Äôre a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-06-05-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

We‚Äôre not talking about fireworks (although those are nice, too). We‚Äôre talking about our good friend and collaborator, Vi‚Äôs incredible three-in-one party night. Vi has been an incredible source of knowledge, inspiration, and persistence throughout all of Tech Learning Collective history. In partnership with others, she co-founded our school and continues to be involved in community efforts to increase the digital literacy and safety of queer and trans folks to this day.</p><p>In many past posts on our blog, as well as across the Web in <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html"">recorded podcasts</a> and on <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/2020/08/03/return-the-magic-to-computers-radio-statler-hope-2020-interview-with-tech-learning-collective.html"">Internet radio</a>, you can listen to her impassioned takes on Internet history and the future of technology, its impact on marginalized groups, and her critiques of Silicon Valley‚Äôs approaches to ‚Äúmaking the world a better place‚Äù all while advocating for a more technologically savvy and self-empowered relationship with digital technology. Although an enigma to many, she is nothing if not iconoclastic, embodying the very best of the trans hacker stereotype.</p><p>Today, Vi plays double-duty as a full time employee back in Silicon Valley after a long personal struggle, as well as remaining a core organizer for the Hex90 queer hacker parties in New York City, an advisor to a number of anarchist tech collectives, and of course a central figure in Tech Learning Collective operations. Vi is turning 1 year old soon, as her HRT anniversary is around the corner and, true to form, she‚Äôs decided to turn her party into something more communal.</p><p>Direct from Vi ‚Äúlike the text editor‚Äù herself:</p><blockquote>  <p>Hi, friends!
