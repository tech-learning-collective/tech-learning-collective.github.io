Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to <a href=""https://hex90.party/"">Hex90’s latest queer hacker salon, “replay,”</a> hosted at <a href=""https://wonderville.nyc/"">Wonderville, where you can buy tickets</a>.</p><pre style=""white-space: pre-wrap;""><code class=""language-txt"">HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYCQueer hackers of the world, unite! There's a war going on. The battlefield is in the mind. And the prize is the soul. Remember, hacking isn't just a crime. It's a survival trait.Hacking is not merely about breaking in; it's also about breaking out. You are the embodiment of escape velocity, from megahertz to gigahertz, each of us individual components in a system that cannot keep up with its constituents. You may feel suffocated by it, trapped in its loops, history repeating itself in the closed minds of politicians, pundits, ""thought leaders,"" or billionaires who kennel you within rings of ""protection."" But you are different: you have already seen what comes next.To move forward, we sometimes must replay pieces of the past. This time, though, we are armed with the experience of a freer future. We have learned their secrets and shared them widely. We can speak their words back to them and claim the power they thought was theirs alone. We are the future they fear because we are already here, and they are the past.They want to undo us. We will replay them, and win—again.info_April 22, 2023 @ Wonderville1186 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 112218:00pm — 4:00am~ this venue is accessible~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms~ this venue has outdoor space~ this venue permits entry only to those aged 21+# dressing up is encouraged but not requiredfeaturing_~ music performances by~~ Nina Vicious~~ trans kafka~~ heaven ender~~ Rana Ransom~~ dis_aster_ous~ livecoded visuals by~~ gwenpri.me~~ Voyde~ live analog visuals by~~ Mike Videopunk~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade~ hacking demos &amp;amp; education by Tech Learning Collective~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL SpaceDANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops.

Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p><h2 id=""about-gwenprime"">About <a href=""https://gwenpri.me/"">gwenpri.me</a></h2><p>gwenpri.me is a creative technologist, artist, and livecoder.
