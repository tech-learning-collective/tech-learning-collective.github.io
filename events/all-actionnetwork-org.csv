"Password Superpowers: How to Crack Hashes and Stump Hackers","Password Superpowers: How to Crack Hashes and Stump Hackers (at  on November 11, 2023)","","","","","","","13:30","11/11/23","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in, how to find out if you have been “pwned,” what the risks are, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force, credential stuffing, and other forms of account takeover attacks.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Have you been “pwned”? For years, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at <a href=""https://haveibeenpwned.com/"">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a> that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is, if your personal information such as your password, has been leaked, accessed, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on, check for yourself!</p>  <p>If you’ve been “pwned,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course</a>, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.</p></blockquote><blockquote>  <p>Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side, learn <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/mr-robots-netflix-n-hack/week-2/strengthening-passwords-to-defend-against-john/README.md"">professional techniques for recovering passwords</a> from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation, such as using optimized wordlists, word-mangling rulesets, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2023-11-11-password-superpowers-how-to-crack-hashes-and-stump-hackers"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p><p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p><p>Please refer to <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/faq/#workshops-and-webinars"">our workshops and webinars FAQ</a> for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.</p><p>As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior <em>will</em> result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules"">our lightweight social rules</a> for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.</p><h2 id=""about-tech-learning-collective"">About Tech Learning Collective</h2><p>Tech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia, Information Technology, and radical political practice.
