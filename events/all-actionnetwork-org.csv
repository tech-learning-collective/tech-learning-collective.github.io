We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>According to <a href=""https://crockford.com/"">Douglas Crockford</a>, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break <em>into</em> (or, <em>break out of</em>) that system.</p>  <p>The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the <a href=""https://www.zaproxy.org/"">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a>, a free and open source Web application security scanner, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more.

"Ship Shape Computing: Working with Containers and Containerizing Digital Workloads","Ship Shape Computing: Working with Containers and Containerizing Digital Workloads (at  on March  5, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","03/05/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Learn how to pack up your code bases, apps, and microservices and get ready to set sail aboard container orchestration platforms in the cloud or on your own metal in this introductory workshop about working with containers. Far from a newfangled buzzword, containerizing digital workloads have precedents dating back to the invention of the UNIX operating system in the 1970’s. Today, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are, where they came from, and how to best use them for DevOps, site reliability, and even enhanced security tasks.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In the earliest days of computing, an application would be responsible for processing only very small amounts of input. It would then produce a similarly small amount of output, working as fast and efficiently as possible. Known as a processing “pipeline,” this early solutions paradigm is most famously expressed as the so-called “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"">UNIX philosophy</a>,” a programmer’s adage that states each program should “do (only) one thing, and do it well,” and it’s still the beating heart of powerful computer interfaces such as <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Computer-Language-Foundations-Command-Line-Basics"">command line use</a> to this day.</p>  <p>Then, all throughout the 1980’s, 90’s, and 2000’s, as computing speed relentlessly increased while its cost simultaneously plummeted, companies began building larger, more complex applications. Known as “monoliths,” this generation of apps were well-suited for their environment, where they were deployed onto singular mainframe-like computers housed inside private server rooms. But these application architectures are no longer sensible in a world where cloud computing and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/The-Imitation-Game-Introduction-to-Administering-Virtual-Machine-Systems"">virtualization technologies</a> make it possible to dynamically reserve compute power as user demand ebbs and flows. Why over-purchase server hardware when you can spin up another virtual machine to handle a spike in traffic, then automatically have that machine shut itself down when incoming requests settle back at manageable levels?</p>  <p>That’s one reason why, today, online apps from Google, Facebook, and others are written as “microservices.” Far from being worthy of the buzzword-driven hype, this paradigm is actually a return to software’s original designs where the goals of a larger application are processed independently by a set of cooperating but independent smaller programs, each one performing only one job very well. To make this work in today’s cloud environments, each microservice must be “containerized,” packaged into a single <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Taming-Daemons-System-Administration-and-Operation-Basics"">Operating System process</a> that is run by a container management engine such as <a href=""https://www.docker.com/"">Docker</a>, <a href=""https://coreos.com/rkt/"">CoreOS’s rkt</a> (pronounced “rocket”), or <a href=""https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/"">LXD</a> in preparation for being orchestrated across a fleet of hundreds or thousands of (often virtual) compute instances.</p>  <p>In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to make use of the thousands of ready-made containers available at container registries such as the <a href=""https://hub.docker.com/"">Docker Hub</a>, create new containers from scratch, containerize existing codebases, manage running containers, and more. We’ll explore how to troubleshoot container failures, show how to network multiple containers together, and touch on container orchestration tools like <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/"">Docker’s Swarm mode</a>, <a href=""https://www.nomadproject.io/"">HashiCorp Nomad</a>, <a href=""https://mesos.apache.org/"">Apache Mesos</a>/<a href=""https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/"">Marathon</a>, and <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a> to see how our containers can be automatically distributed, or “scheduled,” and be tasked with their specialized workloads across a <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Automate-All-the-Things-Infrastructure-as-Code-Primer"">virtual private cloud</a> based on whatever resources we have available to us.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-05-ship-shape-computing-working-with-containers-and-containerizing-digital-workloads"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses, the DNS is actually a massively distributed, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers, anti-spam DNS resource records, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In the digital <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning"">world of cyperspace</a> networks, such as the Internet, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic, such as Web browsing, email, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">google.com</code> in our Web browser?</p>  <p>The answer lies in DNS, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system, the DNS is actually a massive, distributed, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of <em>resource records (RRs)</em>. For instance, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"">SPF</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail"">DKIM</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC"">DMARC</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities"">DANE</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization"">CAA</a> resource records), perform service discovery (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record"">SRV records</a>), and more.</p>  <p>Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop, we’ll <a href=""https://powerdns.org/hello-dns/basic.md.html"">dissect the DNS protocol itself</a>, watching queries and replies, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers, called <em>resolvers</em>, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the <em>zone</em> in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as <a href=""https://dnscrypt.info/"">DNSCrypt</a> v2, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-06-whats-in-a-name-understanding-the-domain-name-system"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Kubernetes is the free, enterprise-grade, cloud-native solution for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This workshop offers an introduction to container orchestration concepts and practices by showing you how to work effectively with <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">kubectl</code>, utilize Labels and Selectors, explore various components of the Kubernetes control plane, and more. You’ll get your own Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy apps, learn how to influence scheduling decisions, and monitor the health of clustered workloads.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>As anyone who has ever moved house knows, the more effectively you can pack, the easier your move will be. It’s a big task, often requiring thousands of tiny decisions to make sure delicate items are wrapped appropriately, all one’s stuff fits neatly into all the available boxes, and so on. Once the boxes are all packed, loading them onto a moving vehicle requires that you distribute their weight more or less evenly so that there are no unpleasant surprises during the move. This is more or less what container orchestration tools are for, except instead of moving physical bins, we have to ship software inside containers. Each container requires resources, like CPU time and memory space, which means we’ll need to play a sort of Tetris game to make sure all our containers fit in the most dense, yet most balanced, arrangement to keep our hardware costs as low as possible.</p>  <p><a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a> is the free and open source industry standard container orchestration platform that provides both system administrators and application developers with a set of tools for cooperatively building, deploying, and maintaining applications at all levels of scale. Its job is to help you get the most out of your hardware by “packing” all your containers (installed server software) into the fewest possible “bins” (physical or virtual machines), and then automatically monitoring, restarting, adding, removing, or shuffling those containers from one machine to another as demand for the services running on your cluster change. Your job is to tell Kubernetes what your ideal deployment situation is, and what to prioritize when resources get scarce.</p>  <p>In this intermediate-level workshop, we’ll build on our knowledge of Linux <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Ship-Shape-Computing-Working-with-Containers-and-Containzerizing-Digital-Workloads"">containers</a> and fundamental system administration tasks to explore a Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn how to inspect workloads using the <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/""><code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">kubectl</code></a> command line utility, a graphical Web-based dashboard, and the Kubernetes API itself. By exploring the <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/"">Kubernetes control plane</a>, you’ll get insight into how Kubernetes makes scheduling decisions and, along with using <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/"">Labels and Selectors</a>, you’ll learn how to influence those scheduling decisions by <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/"">tainting</a> certain resources in specific ways. Finally, you’ll see how Kubernetes provides a set of “cloud-native” services and APIs that developers can use to write apps that spawn more replicas of themselves when needed and perform other forms of automated or self-healing tasks, making the system administrator’s job that much easier.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-12-where-the-sky-meets-the-sea-understanding-container-orchestration-with-kubernetes"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass, fingerprint correlation, and other similar attacks.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or, if you’re really skilled, completely anonymously.</p>  <p>Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals, and so too do politically vocal bloggers, investigative journalists, and citizens.</p>  <p>In this specialized workshop, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers, network relays, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-13-down-the-rabbit-hole-anonymous-publishing-on-the-darknet"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"File Sharing for Fun and Profit: How BitTorrent Works and What You Can Do With It","File Sharing for Fun and Profit: How BitTorrent Works and What You Can Do With It (at  on March 20, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","03/20/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>BitTorrent, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard, Inc. use it every day, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet,” you probably heard of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"">BitTorrent</a> or its more colloquial synonym, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans, financial penalties, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard, immoral, and unsafe to use, but the reality is far less one-sided.</p>  <p><em>BitTorrent</em> refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products, such as <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/141257/htg-explains-how-does-bittorrent-work/"">Blizzard, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company), who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players</a>.</p>  <p>Today, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular, cost-efficient, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like <a href=""https://zeronet.io/"">ZeroNet</a> are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g., <a href=""https://joinpeertube.org/en/"">PeerTube</a>) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called <a href=""https://webtorrent.io/faq"">WebTorrent</a> to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.</p>  <p>In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find, download, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption, connecting to trackers through public proxies and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Two-Places-at-Once-Understanding-Virtual-Private-Networks"">Virtual Private Networks</a>, and building private <a href=""https://seedboxgui.de/"">seedboxes</a>.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-20-file-sharing-for-fun-and-profit-how-bittorrent-works-and-what-you-can-do-with-it"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

With today’s modern automation toolkits, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible, Vagrant, and Terraform, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In today’s IT environments, application servers, databases, file shares, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision, configure, and administer one at a time. To deploy, maintain, and secure large digital fleets, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact; today, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.</p>  <p>Generically called <em>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</em>, modern configuration management tools like <a href=""https://www.ansible.com/"">Ansible</a>, <a href=""https://chef.io/"">Chef</a>, <a href=""https://saltstack.com/"">SaltStack</a>, and <a href=""https://puppet.com/"">Puppet</a> make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like <a href=""https://vagrantup.com/"">Vagrant</a>, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams, massively streamlining everything from software development, to R&amp;D, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard, vendor-neutral, open formats such as <a href=""https://terraform.io/"">Terraform</a> means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts, outages, or even mere accidents can be audited, diagnosed, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC), add multiple machines to it, automatically install server software on those machines, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-26-automate-all-the-things-a-primer-to-infrastructure-as-code"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography, stream and block ciphers, digital signatures, one-way hash functions, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs), and more.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Every time you use a modern computer, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root, these functions, called <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_primitive"">cryptographic primitives</a></em>, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works, from <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers"">password vaults</a> to <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Two-Places-at-Once-Understanding-Virtual-Private-Networks"">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</a> to BitCoin and beyond.</p>  <p>Today, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free, even if they don’t realize it. <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State"">Signal Private Messenger</a>’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)"">Tor anonymity network</a>? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography, and digital signatures, oh my)!</p>  <p>Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e., mathematical <em>weapons</em>, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars"">Crypto Wars</a>” in the 1990’s.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated, practice developing your own simple ciphers, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy), integrity-protection (authenticity), and more. By the end of this workshop, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-03-27-bare-bones-crypto-understanding-critical-cryptographic-primitives"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Something for Everyone: File Servers and Other Network Attached Storage","Something for Everyone: File Servers and Other Network Attached Storage (at  on April  2, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","04/02/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Learn how to provide file sharing services by creating your own networked file server so that your family, friends, or colleagues have a private place to save, share, and work on documents or photos together. Maintaining the humble file server is among the most fundamental Information Technology (IT) department tasks in businesses or organizations big and small because most other activities revolve around document storage and retrieval. In this workshop, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises, like NFS, SMB, and WebDAV.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>As early as 1964, computer makers like IBM, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably, secured properly, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.</p>  <p>These days, however, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized, individuals, community groups, political organizers, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, and Dropbox Paper come in, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free, Libre, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself, for a small group of friends, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV"">WebDAV</a> to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PDFs, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like <a href=""https://nextcloud.com/"">Nextcloud</a>. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage"">Network-Attached Storage (NAS)</a> devices like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol"">(Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</a> that are common in Web hosting environments, and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29"">Network File System (NFS)</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block"">Server Message Block (SMB)</a> protocols that are common in homes and offices.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-04-02-something-for-everyone-file-servers-and-other-network-attached-storage"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work","Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work (at  on April  3, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","04/03/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href=""https://wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing"">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-04-03-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!</p>  <p>These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as <a href=""https://nmap.org/""><code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">nmap</code></a> along with digital wiretapping tools like <a href=""https://www.wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a> we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.</p>  <p>Join us to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-04-09-exploring-cyberspace-network-sniffing-and-scanning"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"The Web as a Language: What No One Ever Told You About HTML That You Didn't Know To Ask","The Web as a Language: What No One Ever Told You About HTML That You Didn't Know To Ask (at  on April 10, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","04/10/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>To take full advantage of the Web, especially as a digital publishing medium, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML, the HyperText Markup Language, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/web101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29"">Microdata</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa"">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-04-10-the-web-as-a-language-what-no-one-ever-told-you-about-html-that-you-didnt-know-to-ask"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

The same water in the ocean rises to the sky before returning to the sea. Which memories fade and which are refreshed? What lies beyond the waterfall of time and space?We are hackers, the witches, the wizards, the techno-sorceresses whose shapes shift within an infinite loop. We are the essence of the more.Constraints do not restrain us. Limitations give us powers others cannot understand because they do not see beyond the overflow.They store integers in finite fields. We use those integers as portals into their machines. They reduce gender to a binary. We stretch those roles to (re)create theaters of infinite expressive possibility. They ""build"" software.

This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our twice-weekly online workshops.
