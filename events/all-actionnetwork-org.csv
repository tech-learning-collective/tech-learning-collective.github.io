"Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail","Securing Email: Protecting Everyday Communications from GMail to ProtonMail (at  on April 30, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","04/30/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>This workshop shows you how to keep your emails private regardless of what email provider you use. By learning how to use the freely and widely available Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cryptosystem in email, you will see how easy it is to not only encrypt messages so that they remain confidential, but also how to make sure the emails you get were really sent by the people they claim to be from. Once you’re able to verify the sender of email you receive, you’re far less likely to get caught up in an email phishing scam ever again.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.</p>  <p>In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail"">ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios</a>. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.</p>  <p>This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using <a href=""https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/"">freely available OpenPGP-compatible software</a>, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-04-30-securing-email-protecting-everyday-communications-from-gmail-to-protonmail"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

This intermediate-level workshop introduces you to Terraform, a free, agentless, masterless, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) digital operations provisioning tool used by many of the largest organizations in the world but simple enough to use on a team of one.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In the beginning, there was the mainframe: a single, gigantic machine that held all the data and did all the work by itself, like a digital planet suspended in the vast emptiness of cyberspace. Then came networks, the personal computer, the Internet, Web 2.0, cloud computing, microservices, and containers—a whole <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning"">cybergalaxy to explore</a>. While the world today looks very different than it did in the days of the mainframe, every project still needs to start at the beginning: get at least one computer to hold all project data and do all project work. So how do modern projects go from a single computer to a whole galaxy so quickly?</p>  <p>For many (including Tech Learning Collective!), the answer is <a href=""https://terraform.io/"">Terraform</a>, a free, open source, and extensible tool that can provision and manage any number of infrastructural resources from source code repositories to cloud compute instances to DNS records and much, much more. Using Terraform, engineers describe the digital environment they’d <em>like</em> to have by writing it down in a simple, declarative configuration language called <a href=""https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html"">HCL</a>. Then, when instructed, Terraform does the work of metaphorically, well, terraforming cyberspace to match the engineer’s description.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of how to set up Terraform for your organization. We’ll also go over best practices for ensuring testing, staging, and production infrastructures stay isolated from one another, how to compose reusable modules, and how to share your Terraform configurations as well as project state with collaborators. At the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how to bring the cloud down to earth.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-01-the-genesis-project-making-and-maintaining-cloud-infrastructure-with-terraform"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our twice-weekly online workshops.

"Computer Language Foundations: Command Line Basics","Computer Language Foundations: Command Line Basics (at  on May 14, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","05/14/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers, hidden away behind locked doors, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly, others scary, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages, the command line, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-14-computer-language-foundations-command-line-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

You’ll see how simple, text-based data files and command-line utilities have been and are still being used in all sorts of applications today, what spreadsheets have to offer, and how all these tools differ from Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) like MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server. This workshop will also touch on Web scraping, form building, mail merges, data cleaning, and other techniques you need to know to make automating the boring parts of your day possible.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>If knowledge is power, what is knowledge? On a computer, knowledge comes from data. By collecting data relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve, you can scrutinize it in various different ways until you’re able to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset; you turn data into information, and from that information you gain knowledge, which gives you power. But this is all much easier said than done, especially if you are not already familiar with how to work with digital data.</p>  <p>This workshop introduces you to the concepts and techniques you need to know to collect, generate, and manipulate digital information regardless of the specific application or problem domain you’re working in. Ever since the dawn of computing, data has been a central element in computer use. After all, what good is a computer without data to compute? Early databases took the form of stacks of physical punch cards. Later on, databases were created out of structured text files (and many of these still exist on your computer today, whether you realize it or not). With the advent of “personal” computing in the 1980’s, digital spreadsheets in applications like Lotus 1-2-3 brought enterprise automation solutions to the masses—or it would have, if more people had the opportunity to learn how to use these powerful tools.</p>  <p>Today, massive datasets with billions or trillions of records are often stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) and are accessed using specialized computer languages such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). These databases are thus the crown jewels of every company or organization conducting business online. Everything that matters to them gets stored in a database of some kind, from email subscriber lists, customer records, call logs, and purchase orders, to social media postings, blog comments, personal photos, and much more. Practice working with different kinds of data to learn the foundations relevant to all data exploration and transformation tasks in this introductory workshop that will help you ensure you can get the right stuff to construct successful solutions to any problem.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-15-getting-the-right-stuff-introduction-to-data-files-spreadsheets-and-databases"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

By learning about foundational frameworks that cybersecurity professionals use to assess risk and safety such as the CIA triad and the three states of data, you’ll build an understanding of information security from first principles to advanced techniques. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to apply these building blocks to anything and everything you do online, or in the streets.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/"">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/about/persona-matrix/"">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix"">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>  <p>Although <a href=""https://prism-break.org/en/"">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State"">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href=""https://keepass.info/"">KeePass</a> or <a href=""https://bitwarden.com/"">Bitwarden</a>, and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-21-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Guardians of the Watchtowers: Introduction to Service Monitoring and Observability","Guardians of the Watchtowers: Introduction to Service Monitoring and Observability (at  on May 22, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","05/22/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Knowing what’s happening on the computers you’re responsible for is a critical part of knowing how to care for and maintain any IT infrastructure. Learn how to automatically monitor and alert on operational issues such as resource exhaustion before they take down your servers and applications. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the “four golden signals” of observability, you’ll be introduced to time series databases and metrics collection with Prometheus, and you’ll learn how to create beautiful charts and graphs from that data with Grafana. Together, these free, industry-standard tools comprise the foundation of all modern and cloud-native IT monitoring stacks.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Every computer program needs certain resources to operate well, like memory and disk space and CPU cycles. This is true both for simple programs on your laptop and also for complex, cloud-native systems like those that run in massive compute clusters in public cloud or on-premises datacenters. On a single computer, tools like the <a href=""https://support.apple.com/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac"">Activity Monitor</a> on macOS or the <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/405806/windows-task-manager-the-complete-guide/"">Task Manager</a> on Windows can report which applications are taking up what amount of specific resources on your computer in near real-time, helping you keep watch over your digital domain. When you need to monitor whole fleets of servers, though, you need tools that can scrape or collect the same information from those servers over a network.</p>  <p>In decades past, IT teams were often limited to static data sets to perform tasks like asset tracking. As applications grew more complex, performance and reliability metrics became increasingly important, so instrumentation, profiling, and visualization tools like <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/health-checks/"">dedicated health and readiness checks</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Performance/Flame_Chart"">flame charts</a> were developed to help engineers figure out how to both optimize the code they wrote and how to integrate it with other systems more seamlessly. Today, specialized frameworks and burgeoning standards like <a href=""https://opentelemetry.io/"">OpenTelemetry</a> are designed to give system operators more visibility into both the current and historical usage trends and patterns of the resources their services need to run well. Equipped with this information, they can make better capacity planning decisions for the future or even help identify anomalous events like security breaches, bugs in code, and other subtle issues that might be hard or impossible to track down otherwise.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll be introduced to the concepts and practices of observability for infrastructure at any level of scale. You’ll learn about the “four golden signals”—latency, traffic, errors, and saturation—and why they matter. Like the four Quarters that are called to cast a magical circle, each golden signal has a particular focus and almost elemental meaning. You’ll learn how to install and configure <a href=""https://prometheus.io/"">Prometheus</a>, the open, industry-standard metrics collection solution on which many commercial offerings are based, along with its accompanying components like <a href=""https://www.prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/"">Alertmanager</a>, metric <a href=""https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/"">exporters</a>, and supplemental software like <a href=""https://grafana.com/"">Grafana</a> that can query Prometheus’s time series database to reveal trends, patterns, or anomalies in your systems’ stability over time. Finally, to make sense of all this data, you’ll get an introduction to <a href=""https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/"">PromQL</a>, the purpose-built Prometheus Query Language used for everything from triggering alerts to making custom queries so you’ll always be able to know exactly what’s going on in your infrastructure when you need to.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-22-guardians-of-the-watchtowers-introduction-to-service-monitoring-and-observability"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop, but with global systems of law, finance, and even art, literature, and philosophy governing today’s world.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-05-28-taming-daemons-system-administration-and-operation-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake.

Commonly called a <em>cluster</em>, these servers need to be managed as a group, ensuring that their software configurations, security patches, and installed packages are deployed, maintained, and eventually updated or retired in a predictable way.</p>  <p>In this deep dive workshop, we’ll set up our own small cluster and use <a href=""https://ansible.com/"">Ansible</a>, which is an agentless, cross-platform, enterprise-grade, free software <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management"">Configuration Management (CM)</a> and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Automate-All-the-Things-Infrastructure-as-Code-Primer"">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> framework used by giant corporations like IBM and Cisco, to turn old-school operator runbooks into computerized playbooks that can be executed quickly and easily even by novice operators. Through several hands-on exercises, you’ll learn about the entire CM lifecycle from planning through auditing so that you understand critical CM concepts like idempotence, change control, and more, which are common to all CM systems including <a href=""https://www.chef.io/configuration-management/"">Chef</a>, <a href=""https://puppet.com/use-cases/configuration-management/"">Puppet</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/states/"">Salt</a>.</p>  <p>Along the way, you’ll be exposed to key concepts such as <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Ship-Shape-Computing-Working-with-Containers-and-Containzerizing-Digital-Workloads"">containerization</a> through Ansible’s support for automating container builds, <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/con"">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</a> via Ansible’s AWX Project, and more. By adopting configuration management workflows with tools like Ansible, you can reduce operator errors, and beat back configuration drift on any long-lived infrastructure components.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-06-04-faster-than-light-getting-started-with-configuration-management"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

(at  on June  5, 2022)","","","","","","","13:30","06/05/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2022-06-05-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.
