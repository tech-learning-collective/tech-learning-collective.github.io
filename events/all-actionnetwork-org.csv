"Vi's Triple Header Happy Birthday Happy Hour","Vi's Triple Header Happy Birthday Happy Hour (at Wonderville on July  5, 2022)","Wonderville","1186 Broadway","Brooklyn","NY","11221","","17:00","07/05/22","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Start Summer off with a bang. We‚Äôre not talking about fireworks (although those are nice, too). We‚Äôre talking about our good friend and collaborator, Vi‚Äôs incredible three-in-one party night. Vi has been an incredible source of knowledge, inspiration, and persistence throughout all of Tech Learning Collective history. In partnership with others, she co-founded our school and continues to be involved in community efforts to increase the digital literacy and safety of queer and trans folks to this day.</p><p>In many past posts on our blog, as well as across the Web in <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html"">recorded podcasts</a> and on <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/2020/08/03/return-the-magic-to-computers-radio-statler-hope-2020-interview-with-tech-learning-collective.html"">Internet radio</a>, you can listen to her impassioned takes on Internet history and the future of technology, its impact on marginalized groups, and her critiques of Silicon Valley‚Äôs approaches to ‚Äúmaking the world a better place‚Äù all while advocating for a more technologically savvy and self-empowered relationship with digital technology. Although an enigma to many, she is nothing if not iconoclastic, embodying the very best of the trans hacker stereotype.</p><p>Today, Vi plays double-duty as a full time employee back in Silicon Valley after a long personal struggle, as well as remaining a core organizer for the Hex90 queer hacker parties in New York City, an advisor to a number of anarchist tech collectives, and of course a central figure in Tech Learning Collective operations. Vi is turning 1 year old soon, as her HRT anniversary is around the corner and, true to form, she‚Äôs decided to turn her party into something more communal.</p><p>Direct from Vi ‚Äúlike the text editor‚Äù herself:</p><blockquote>  <p>Hi, friends! Pride Month has come and gone but there‚Äôs one more (massive) celebration to be had!</p>  <p>Join me, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event: the company I work for tapped me to organize a ‚ÄúHow was your pride?‚Äù post-pride month Happy Hour, and I‚Äôm combining it with my ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù party and the next <a href=""https://killerqueenarcade.com/"">Killer Queen</a> Open Hive Night at Wonderville.</p>  <p>The ‚ÄúHow was your Pride?‚Äù Happy Hour is for my co-workers in NYC, and I‚Äôm inviting them all to combine forces with the NYC Killer Queen scene for their weekly <a href=""https://www.wonderville.nyc/events/killerqueen-07-05-2022"">Open Hive Night</a>.

By sunlight and moonlight, take flight! Let us imagine ourselves as stardust returning to our celestial origins, intertwingled together. We will burn the stars with our radiance!Hackers are elemental. Like water, we are shapeless, yet we are every shape. We transition between states as our environment changes, changing the environment in the process. We can be as hard as ice, or as soft as flame. Opaque, or invisible, or spanning everything in between, we are the cloud. Ours is flesh that forms as quickly as it may float away. Impenetrable, or permeable. Our bodies, our choices, from one fluid moment to the next.Information packets traverse the ether. Netflows quickly vanish over the horizon. There are traces of fire on the wire connecting our vibrating crystalline bodies. Sniff the wire to prime your electronic memory with the sounds of conversations past and present.

This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short ""trailer,"" the game is not available on the public Internet.)After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops.
