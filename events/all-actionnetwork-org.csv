If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href=""https://wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing"">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-08-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up, access, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself, friends, or comrades.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href=""https://signal.org/"">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href=""https://wordpress.org/"">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap"">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sys101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Networking</a>, and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance.

Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href=""https://www.veracrypt.fr/"">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href=""https://www.inetsim.org/"">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href=""https://www.qemu.org/"">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href=""https://www.proxmox.com/"">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href=""https://www.qubes-os.org/"">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html"">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers"">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href=""https://virtualbox.org/"">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-15-the-imitation-game-introduction-to-administering-virtual-machine-systems"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop, but with global systems of law, finance, and even art, literature, and philosophy governing today’s world.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-17-taming-daemons-system-administration-and-operation-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer, novelist, or art designer.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href=""https://git-scm.com/"">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href=""https://github.com/"">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-19-collaboration-across-universes-basics-of-version-control-with-git"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href=""https://wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing"">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-19-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams","Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams (at  on February 21, 2020)","","","","","","","13:00","02/21/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>  <p>In 2019, <a href=""https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html"">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href=""https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches"">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href=""https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html"">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href=""https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites"">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-02-21-gone-phishing-how-to-recognize-fake-websites-and-other-online-scams"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/"">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/about/persona-matrix/"">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix"">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>  <p>Although <a href=""https://prism-break.org/en/"">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State"">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href=""https://keepass.info/"">KeePass</a> or <a href=""https://lastpass.com/"">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle.

This workshop presents the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) the same way you might learn a new written language. By understanding the language’s grammar and vocabulary, you can compose surprisingly complex and powerful Web pages without needing to know a programming language like JavaScript. If you’ve used a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you have all the prerequisites you need to understand, at a deep and foundational level, what HTML is and how it works.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/web101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29"">Microdata</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa"">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-01-the-web-as-a-language-what-no-one-ever-told-you-about-html-that-you-didnt-know-to-ask"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up, access, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself, friends, or comrades.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href=""https://signal.org/"">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href=""https://wordpress.org/"">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap"">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sys101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Networking</a>, and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance.

In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop, but with global systems of law, finance, and even art, literature, and philosophy governing today’s world.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-07-taming-daemons-system-administration-and-operation-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Maybe you imagined secret chambers, hidden away behind locked doors, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly, others scary, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages, the command line, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-08-computer-language-foundations-command-line-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href=""https://www.veracrypt.fr/"">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href=""https://www.inetsim.org/"">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href=""https://www.qemu.org/"">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href=""https://www.proxmox.com/"">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href=""https://www.qubes-os.org/"">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html"">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers"">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href=""https://virtualbox.org/"">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-09-the-imitation-game-introduction-to-administering-virtual-machine-systems"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-12-gone-phishing-how-to-recognize-fake-websites-and-other-online-scams"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

(at  on March 15, 2020)","","","","","","","14:30","03/15/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-03-15-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.
