We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>According to <a href=""https://crockford.com/"">Douglas Crockford</a>, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break <em>into</em> (or, <em>break out of</em>) that system.</p>  <p>The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the <a href=""https://www.zaproxy.org/"">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a>, a free and open source Web application security scanner, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more. We’ll be targeting the <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/"">OWASP Juice Shop</a>, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/"">OWASP Top Ten</a>. They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.</p>  <p>Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, install malware on your systems, or penetrate your network.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-05-17-world-wide-wars-introduction-to-exploiting-web-applications"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography, stream and block ciphers, digital signatures, one-way hash functions, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs), and more.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Every time you use a modern computer, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root, these functions, called <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_primitive"">cryptographic primitives</a></em>, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works, from <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers"">password vaults</a> to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to BitCoin and beyond.</p>  <p>Today, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free, even if they don’t realize it. <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State"">Signal Private Messenger</a>’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)"">Tor anonymity network</a>? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography, and digital signatures, oh my)!</p>  <p>Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e., mathematical <em>weapons</em>, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars"">Crypto Wars</a>” in the 1990’s.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated, practice developing your own simple ciphers, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy), integrity-protection (authenticity), and more. By the end of this workshop, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-05-20-bare-bones-crypto-understanding-critical-cryptographic-primitives"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href=""https://www.veracrypt.fr/"">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href=""https://www.inetsim.org/"">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href=""https://www.qemu.org/"">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href=""https://www.proxmox.com/"">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href=""https://www.qubes-os.org/"">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html"">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers"">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href=""https://virtualbox.org/"">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-05-23-the-imitation-game-introduction-to-administering-virtual-machine-systems"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

With today’s modern automation toolkits, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible, Vagrant, and Terraform, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In today’s IT environments, application servers, databases, file shares, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision, configure, and administer one at a time. To deploy, maintain, and secure large digital fleets, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact; today, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.</p>  <p>Generically called <em>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</em>, modern configuration management tools like <a href=""https://www.ansible.com/"">Ansible</a>, <a href=""https://chef.io/"">Chef</a>, <a href=""https://saltstack.com/"">SaltStack</a>, and <a href=""https://puppet.com/"">Puppet</a> make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like <a href=""https://vagrantup.com/"">Vagrant</a>, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams, massively streamlining everything from software development, to R&amp;D, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard, vendor-neutral, open formats such as <a href=""https://terraform.io/"">Terraform</a> means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts, outages, or even mere accidents can be audited, diagnosed, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC), add multiple machines to it, automatically install server software on those machines, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-05-26-automate-all-the-things-a-primer-to-infrastructure-as-code"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

And even after enlisting help from tech giants like Google, unemployed residents still describe the situation as <a href=""https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-unemployment-benefits-in-ny-is-still-a-kafkaesque-mess"">a “living nightmare” and “kafkaesque mess,”</a> reporting delays, backlogs, and even cases where the system <a href=""https://gothamist.com/news/nys-overwhelmed-unemployment-benefits-system-leaked-personal-information"">leaked applicants’ social security numbers to strangers</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, although government officials have temporarily ceased evictions on paper, <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/despite-federal-ban-landlords-are-still-moving-to-evict-people-during-the-pandemic"">many landlords have moved to evict tenants anyway</a>.

"Computer Language Foundations: Command Line Basics","Computer Language Foundations: Command Line Basics (at  on June  1, 2020)","","","","","","","16:30","06/01/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers, hidden away behind locked doors, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly, others scary, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages, the command line, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-01-computer-language-foundations-command-line-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

In a way, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>At their core, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper, they allow us to record our thoughts, dreams, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors, industrial control systems, biomedical devices, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.</p>  <p>When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose, text-only interface called a <em><a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/"">command line</a></em>. Individually, these instructions are called <em>invocations</em>. (Yes, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to write whole spells, rituals, or (sacred) texts called <em>shell scripts</em> to inscribe your own thoughts, dreams, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.</p>  <p>By saving your scripts in files, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and, as such, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-03-writing-with-blue-fire-shell-scripting-for-beginners"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams","Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams (at  on June  7, 2020)","","","","","","","16:30","06/07/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>  <p>In 2019, <a href=""https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html"">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href=""https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches"">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href=""https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html"">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href=""https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites"">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/sec101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-07-gone-phishing-how-to-recognize-fake-websites-and-other-online-scams"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Collaboration Across Universes: Basics of Version Control with Git","Collaboration Across Universes: Basics of Version Control with Git (at  on June 11, 2020)","","","","","","","15:30","06/11/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Ever work on a project with other people? Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer, novelist, or art designer.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href=""https://git-scm.com/"">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href=""https://github.com/"">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-11-collaboration-across-universes-basics-of-version-control-with-git"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Developing Digital Dexterity: Introduction to JavaScript","Developing Digital Dexterity: Introduction to JavaScript (at  on June 13, 2020)","","","","","","","16:00","06/13/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g., Google Apps Script, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API), develop PC games (using GDevelop), and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope, prototype-based object inheritance, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser, office job, or your own project.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Over the course of ten days in 1995, the Web changed forever when Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape, Inc. and developed a programming language that could be embedded in Web pages. Briefly named LiveScript, the language became known as JavaScript three months later, and was officially standardized as ECMAScript in 1997 after taking the Internet by storm only two years later. Today, JavaScript is arguably the single most popular and prolific high-level language available to many people for many projects.</p>  <p>Although most people know of JavaScript as the programming language of the Web, where <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API"">its capabilities</a> have increased dramatically over the years, many other environments outside of the Web browser or traditional Web application now embed or rely on JavaScript engines to work. Entire back-end applications can be created with “server-side JavaScript” (<a href=""https://nodejs.org/"">Node.js</a>, <a href=""https://www.ringojs.org/"">RingoJS</a>), Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices like sensors and larger microcontrollers offer JavaScript scriptable interfaces (<a href=""https://www.espruino.com/"">Espruino</a>, <a href=""https://www.neonious.com/lowjs/"">low.js</a>), mundane office jobs and “paperwork” can be accomplished in JavaScript (<a href=""https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Scripting/JavaScript_Editor"">OpenOffice</a>/LibreOffice Script Provider, <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/"">Google Apps Script</a>, <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview"">Microsoft Office JavaScript API</a>), desktop and PC game programming can be done entirely in JavaScript (<a href=""https://gdevelop-app.com/javascript-game-engine/"">GDevelop</a>, <a href=""https://www.babylonjs.com/"">Babylon.js</a>), some other programming languages are implemented in JavaScript (<a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"">Scratch</a>), and JavaScript can even be used for macOS system automation tasks using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript#Open_Scripting_Architecture"">Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) JavaScript for Automation extension</a>. Almost no other programming language is as easy to learn while offering the breadth of options that JavaScript does, which is one clear reason for the language’s popularity among developers and desirability among employers.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment. By focusing on the language’s built-in constructs, you’ll be able to avoid many common pitfalls and understand what makes JavaScript tick. We’ll cover some programming basics common to all languages, but we’ll also show how JavaScript’s unusual rules (functional scope, prototype-based object inheritance, etc.) make it possible to write especially elegant—or especially dangerous—code, as well as showing you why developing even minimal proficiency with JavaScript will drastically increase your “digital dexterity” as you browse the Web.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-13-developing-digital-dexterity-introduction-to-javascript"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p><p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone.

But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.

We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>According to <a href=""https://crockford.com/"">Douglas Crockford</a>, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break <em>into</em> (or, <em>break out of</em>) that system.</p>  <p>The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the <a href=""https://www.zaproxy.org/"">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a>, a free and open source Web application security scanner, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more. We’ll be targeting the <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/"">OWASP Juice Shop</a>, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the <a href=""https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/"">OWASP Top Ten</a>. They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.</p>  <p>Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, install malware on your systems, or penetrate your network.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-16-world-wide-wars-introduction-to-exploiting-web-applications"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses, the DNS is actually a massively distributed, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers, anti-spam DNS resource records, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In the digital <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Exploring-Cyberspace-Network-Sniffing-and-Scanning"">world of cyperspace</a> networks, such as the Internet, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic, such as Web browsing, email, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">google.com</code> in our Web browser?</p>  <p>The answer lies in DNS, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system, the DNS is actually a massive, distributed, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of <em>resource records (RRs)</em>. For instance, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"">SPF</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail"">DKIM</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC"">DMARC</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities"">DANE</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization"">CAA</a> resource records), perform service discovery (with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record"">SRV records</a>), and more.</p>  <p>Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself, watching queries and replies, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers, called <em>resolvers</em>, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the <em>zone</em> in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as <a href=""https://dnscrypt.info/"">DNSCrypt</a> v2, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-18-whats-in-a-name-understanding-the-domain-name-system"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/net101.html"">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href=""https://wireshark.org/"">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing"">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-20-clearing-away-the-clouds-how-computer-networks-servers-and-the-internet-work"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Shields Up: Firewalls and Other Network Perimeter Defenses","Shields Up: Firewalls and Other Network Perimeter Defenses (at  on June 21, 2020)","","","","","","","16:30","06/21/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS, Windows, BSD, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">iptables</code>, <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">nft</code>, and <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">pfctl</code>), you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools like pfSense as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In today’s ubiquitous computing environment, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Clearing-Away-the-Clouds-How-Computer-Networks,-Servers,-and-the-Internet-Work"">network connection</a>. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router, just about <em>every</em> computer has a firewall these days, including your personal laptop.</p>  <p>Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).</p>  <p>But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called <a href=""https://www.netfilter.org/"">Netfilter</a> and controlled with the <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">iptables</code> or <code class=""language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"">nft</code> commands) is the backbone of almost all commercial enterprise firewall distributions, and it’s available free of charge. Plus, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/network/"">Docker’s networking</a> and Kubernetes’s <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/"">kube-proxy</a>, among others.</p>  <p>So, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-21-shields-up-firewalls-and-other-network-perimeter-defenses"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Ship Shape Computing: Working with Containers and Containerizing Digital Workloads","Ship Shape Computing: Working with Containers and Containerizing Digital Workloads (at  on June 23, 2020)","","","","","","","16:00","06/23/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Learn how to pack up your code bases, apps, and microservices and get ready to set sail aboard container orchestration platforms in the cloud or on your own metal in this introductory workshop about working with containers. Far from a newfangled buzzword, containerizing digital workloads have precedents dating back to the invention of the UNIX operating system in the 1970’s. Today, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are, where they came from, and how to best use them for DevOps, site reliability, and even enhanced security tasks.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In the earliest days of computing, an application would be responsible for processing only very small amounts of input. It would then produce a similarly small amount of output, working as fast and efficiently as possible. Known as a processing “pipeline,” this early solutions paradigm is most famously expressed as the so-called “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"">UNIX philosophy</a>,” a programmer’s adage that states each program should “do (only) one thing, and do it well,” and it’s still the beating heart of powerful computer interfaces such as <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Computer-Language-Foundations-Command-Line-Basics"">command line use</a> to this day.</p>  <p>Then, all throughout the 1980’s, 90’s, and 2000’s, as computing speed relentlessly increased while its cost simultaneously plummeted, companies began building larger, more complex applications. Known as “monoliths,” this generation of apps were well-suited for their environment, where they were deployed onto singular mainframe-like computers housed inside private server rooms. But these application architectures are no longer sensible in a world where cloud computing and <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/The-Imitation-Game-Introduction-to-Administering-Virtual-Machine-Systems"">virtualization technologies</a> make it possible to dynamically reserve compute power as user demand ebbs and flows. Why over-purchase server hardware when you can spin up another virtual machine to handle a spike in traffic, then automatically have that machine shut itself down when incoming requests settle back at manageable levels?</p>  <p>That’s one reason why, today, online apps from Google, Facebook, and others are written as “microservices.” Far from being worthy of the buzzword-driven hype, this paradigm is actually a return to software’s original designs where the goals of a larger application are processed independently by a set of cooperating but independent smaller programs, each one performing only one job very well. To make this work in today’s cloud environments, each microservice must be “containerized,” packaged into a single <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Taming-Daemons-System-Administration-and-Operation-Basics"">Operating System process</a> that is run by a container management engine such as <a href=""https://www.docker.com/"">Docker</a>, <a href=""https://coreos.com/rkt/"">CoreOS’s rkt</a> (pronounced “rocket”), or <a href=""https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/"">LXD</a> in preparation for being orchestrated across a fleet of hundreds or thousands of (often virtual) compute instances.</p>  <p>In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to make use of the thousands of ready-made containers available at container registries such as the <a href=""https://hub.docker.com/"">Docker Hub</a>, create new containers from scratch, containerize existing codebases, manage running containers, and more. We’ll explore how to troubleshoot container failures, show how to network multiple containers together, and touch on container orchestration tools like <a href=""https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/"">Docker’s Swarm mode</a>, <a href=""https://www.nomadproject.io/"">HashiCorp Nomad</a>, <a href=""https://mesos.apache.org/"">Apache Mesos</a>, and <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a> to see how our containers can be automatically distributed, or “scheduled,” and be tasked with their specialized workloads across a <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Automate-All-the-Things-Infrastructure-as-Code-Primer"">virtual private cloud</a> based on whatever resources we have available to us.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-23-ship-shape-computing-working-with-containers-and-containerizing-digital-workloads"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"The Imitation Game: Introduction to Administering Virtual Machine Systems","The Imitation Game: Introduction to Administering Virtual Machine Systems (at  on June 25, 2020)","","","","","","","15:30","06/25/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>This workshop is a practical introduction to creating, using, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href=""https://www.veracrypt.fr/"">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href=""https://www.inetsim.org/"">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href=""https://www.qemu.org/"">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href=""https://www.proxmox.com/"">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href=""https://www.qubes-os.org/"">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html"">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers"">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href=""https://virtualbox.org/"">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-25-the-imitation-game-introduction-to-administering-virtual-machine-systems"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

"Taming Daemons: System Administration and Operation Basics","Taming Daemons: System Administration and Operation Basics (at  on June 29, 2020)","","","","","","","15:30","06/29/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop, but with global systems of law, finance, and even art, literature, and philosophy governing today’s world.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-06-29-taming-daemons-system-administration-and-operation-basics"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p><p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone.

"File Sharing for Fun and Profit: How BitTorrent Works and What You Can Do With It","File Sharing for Fun and Profit: How BitTorrent Works and What You Can Do With It (at  on July  1, 2020)","","","","","","","15:30","07/01/20","","techlearningcollective@riseup.net","<p>BitTorrent, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard, Inc. use it every day, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet,” you probably heard of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"">BitTorrent</a> or its more colloquial synonym, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans, financial penalties, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard, immoral, and unsafe to use, but the reality is far less one-sided.</p>  <p><em>BitTorrent</em> refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products, such as <a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/141257/htg-explains-how-does-bittorrent-work/"">Blizzard, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company), who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players</a>.</p>  <p>Today, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular, cost-efficient, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like <a href=""https://zeronet.io/"">ZeroNet</a> are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g., <a href=""https://joinpeertube.org/en/"">PeerTube</a>) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called <a href=""https://webtorrent.io/faq"">WebTorrent</a> to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.</p>  <p>In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find, download, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption, connecting to trackers through public proxies, and building private <a href=""https://seedboxgui.de/"">seedboxes</a>.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-07-01-file-sharing-for-fun-and-profit-how-bittorrent-works-and-what-you-can-do-with-it"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

Whether for a Web application, big data processing, or other project, you need to turn old-school runbooks into computerized playbooks that can execute Standard Operating Procedures quickly and reliably so you can deploy complex systems simply and predictably. Come learn about key concepts like idempotence and change control, and learn how giant corporations implement security principles like RBAC, all using free and open source software.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>Today, all but the most trivial of computer systems rely on an interdependent set of servers working in concert. You don’t just have one server, you have a group of them.

With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/"">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/about/persona-matrix/"">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href=""https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix"">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>  <p>Although <a href=""https://prism-break.org/en/"">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State"">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href=""https://keepass.info/"">KeePass</a> or <a href=""https://lastpass.com/"">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-07-10-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

In a way, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>At their core, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper, they allow us to record our thoughts, dreams, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors, industrial control systems, biomedical devices, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.</p>  <p>When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose, text-only interface called a <em><a href=""https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/"">command line</a></em>. Individually, these instructions are called <em>invocations</em>. (Yes, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to write whole spells, rituals, or (sacred) texts called <em>shell scripts</em> to inscribe your own thoughts, dreams, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.</p>  <p>By saving your scripts in files, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and, as such, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-07-11-writing-with-blue-fire-shell-scripting-for-beginners"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.

With today’s modern automation toolkits, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible, Vagrant, and Terraform, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.</p><h2 id=""workshop-description"">Workshop Description</h2><blockquote>  <p>In today’s IT environments, application servers, databases, file shares, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision, configure, and administer one at a time. To deploy, maintain, and secure large digital fleets, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact; today, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.</p>  <p>Generically called <em>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</em>, modern configuration management tools like <a href=""https://www.ansible.com/"">Ansible</a>, <a href=""https://chef.io/"">Chef</a>, <a href=""https://saltstack.com/"">SaltStack</a>, and <a href=""https://puppet.com/"">Puppet</a> make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like <a href=""https://vagrantup.com/"">Vagrant</a>, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams, massively streamlining everything from software development, to R&amp;D, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard, vendor-neutral, open formats such as <a href=""https://terraform.io/"">Terraform</a> means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts, outages, or even mere accidents can be audited, diagnosed, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.</p>  <p>In this workshop, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC), add multiple machines to it, automatically install server software on those machines, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.</p></blockquote><p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href=""#tickets-workshop-2020-07-18-automate-all-the-things-a-primer-to-infrastructure-as-code"">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p><p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/"">Google Chrome</a>.
