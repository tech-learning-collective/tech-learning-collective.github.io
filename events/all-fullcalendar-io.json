You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution, so that you can connect securely to your home, office, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.",
