    <h2>Events Calendar</h2>
    <p>In addition to our intensive <a href="/courses/">courses</a>, we also host satellite events such as <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a>, skillshares, and demonstrations in collaboration with community centers, hackerspaces and hacklabs, and <a href="/calendars/">other groups</a> across New York City, and elsewhere via Internet video conference. Our satellite workshops are a low-commitment way to get a feel for our more intensive courses as well as meet some of our teaching team. Existing Tech Learning Collective students studying cybersecurity may also want to participate in one or more <a href="/events/ctfs.html">upcoming CTFs</a>.</p>

While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials, like how to understand the concept of document flow, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size, position, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries, modern layout modules, and other CSS capabilities.",

A phishing attack is surprisingly low-tech, which is part of what makes it so devastatingly effective. Learning to spot these attacks is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself online, since a hacker’s tricks, called “lures,” can appear anywhere from an email, to a Facebook message, to a real Web site that looks exactly like one you recognize!
