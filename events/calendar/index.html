    <h2>Events Calendar</h2>
    <p>In addition to our intensive <a href="/courses/">courses</a>, we also host satellite events such as <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a>, skillshares, and demonstrations in collaboration with community centers, hackerspaces and hacklabs, and <a href="/calendars/">other groups</a> across New York City, and elsewhere via Internet video conference. Our satellite workshops are a low-commitment way to get a feel for our more intensive courses as well as meet some of our teaching team. Existing Tech Learning Collective students studying cybersecurity may also want to participate in one or more <a href="/events/ctfs.html">upcoming CTFs</a>.</p>

Today, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are, where they came from, and how to best use them for DevOps, site reliability, and even enhanced security tasks.",
