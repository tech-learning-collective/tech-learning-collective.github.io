    <h2>Events Calendar</h2>
    <p>In addition to our intensive <a href="/courses/">courses</a>, we also host satellite events such as <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a>, skillshares, and demonstrations in collaboration with community centers, hackerspaces and hacklabs, and <a href="/calendars/">other groups</a> across New York City, and elsewhere via Internet video conference. Our satellite workshops are a low-commitment way to get a feel for our more intensive courses as well as meet some of our teaching team. Existing Tech Learning Collective students studying cybersecurity may also want to participate in one or more <a href="/events/ctfs.html">upcoming CTFs</a>.</p>

    "teaser": "JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g., Google Apps Script, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API), develop PC games (using GDevelop), and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope, prototype-based object inheritance, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser, office job, or your own project.",

    "teaser": "The way some hypermedia object, like a Web page, presents itself is encoded using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials, like how to understand the concept of document flow, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size, position, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries, modern layout modules, and other CSS capabilities.",
