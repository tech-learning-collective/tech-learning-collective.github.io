    <h2>Events Calendar</h2>
    <p>In addition to our intensive <a href="/courses/">courses</a>, we also host satellite events such as <a href="/workshops/">workshops</a>, skillshares, and demonstrations in collaboration with community centers, hackerspaces and hacklabs, and <a href="/calendars/">other groups</a> across New York City, and elsewhere via Internet video conference. Our satellite workshops are a low-commitment way to get a feel for our more intensive courses as well as meet some of our teaching team. Existing Tech Learning Collective students studying cybersecurity may also want to participate in one or more <a href="/events/ctfs.html">upcoming CTFs</a>.</p>

In a way, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.",

In this workshop, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises, like NFS, SMB, and WebDAV.",
