DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to pilot Kubernetes and find out how it helps you get the most value out of your hardware. Kubernetes is the free\, enterprise-grade\, cloud-native solution for automated deployment\, scaling\, and management of containerized applications. This workshop offers an introduction to container orchestration concepts and practices by showing you how to work effectively with kubectl\, utilize Labels and Selectors\, explore various components of the Kubernetes control plane\, and more. You’ll get your own Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy apps\, learn how to influence scheduling decisions\, and monitor the health of clustered workloads.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As anyone who has ever moved house knows\, the more effectively you can pack\, the easier your move will be. It’s a big task\, often requiring thousands of tiny decisions to make sure delicate items are wrapped appropriately\, all one’s stuff fits neatly into all the available boxes\, and so on. Once the boxes are all packed\, loading them onto a moving vehicle requires that you distribute their weight more or less evenly so that there are no unpleasant surprises during the move. This is more or less what container orchestration tools are for\, except instead of moving physical bins\, we have to ship software inside containers. Each container requires resources\, like CPU time and memory space\, which means we’ll need to play a sort of Tetris game to make sure all our containers fit in the most dense\, yet most balanced\, arrangement to keep our hardware costs as low as possible.\n\n  Kubernetes is the free and open source industry standard container orchestration platform that provides both system administrators and application developers with a set of tools for cooperatively building\, deploying\, and maintaining applications at all levels of scale. Its job is to help you get the most out of your hardware by “packing” all your containers (installed server software) into the fewest possible “bins” (physical or virtual machines)\, and then automatically monitoring\, restarting\, adding\, removing\, or shuffling those containers from one machine to another as demand for the services running on your cluster change. Your job is to tell Kubernetes what your ideal deployment situation is\, and what to prioritize when resources get scarce.\n\n  In this intermediate-level workshop\, we’ll build on our knowledge of Linux containers and fundamental system administration tasks to explore a Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn how to inspect workloads using the kubectl command line utility\, a graphical Web-based dashboard\, and the Kubernetes API itself. By exploring the Kubernetes control plane\, you’ll get insight into how Kubernetes makes scheduling decisions and\, along with using Labels and Selectors\, you’ll learn how to influence those scheduling decisions by tainting certain resources in specific ways. Finally\, you’ll see how Kubernetes provides a set of “cloud-native” services and APIs that developers can use to write apps that spawn more replicas of themselves when needed and perform other forms of automated or self-healing tasks\, making the system administrator’s job that much easier.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety will cut through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle\, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds\, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts\,” how do you know which tool to use\, when\, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really should use\, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover\, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself\, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?\n\n  This beginner’s workshop taught by the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers offers a simple framework anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective\, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City\, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money\, people\, etcetera) does my attacker have?”\n\n  Although there are many good and free tools available\, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like Signal)\, a password manager (like KeePass or Bitwarden\, and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers\, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short\, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place\, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you should take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to inscribe your thoughts\, dreams\, and desires into your computer and take your command line skills to the next level by learning how to write simple programs called shell scripts. In a way\, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively\, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs\, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  At their core\, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper\, they allow us to record our thoughts\, dreams\, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper\, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible\, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors\, industrial control systems\, biomedical devices\, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.\n\n  When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer\, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose\, text-only interface called a command line. Individually\, these instructions are called invocations. (Yes\, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to write whole spells\, rituals\, or (sacred) texts called shell scripts to inscribe your own thoughts\, dreams\, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.\n\n  By saving your scripts in files\, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and\, as such\, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work\, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in\, how to find out if you have been “pwned\,” what the risks are\, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force\, credential stuffing\, and other forms of account takeover attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you been “pwned”? For years\, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at HaveIBeenPwned.com that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is\, if your personal information such as your password\, has been leaked\, accessed\, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on\, check for yourself!\n\n  If you’ve been “pwned\,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be\, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course\, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.\n\n\n\n  Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them\, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side\, learn professional techniques for recovering passwords from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation\, such as using optimized wordlists\, word-mangling rulesets\, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to manage your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) datacenter environment and make the most of cloud infrastructure providers (“IaaS platforms”) by automatically deploying underlying infrastructure\, including network topology\, firewall rulesets\, DNS records\, and other resources. This intermediate-level workshop introduces you to Terraform\, a free\, agentless\, masterless\, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) digital operations provisioning tool used by many of the largest organizations in the world but simple enough to use on a team of one.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the beginning\, there was the mainframe: a single\, gigantic machine that held all the data and did all the work by itself\, like a digital planet suspended in the vast emptiness of cyberspace. Then came networks\, the personal computer\, the Internet\, Web 2.0\, cloud computing\, microservices\, and containers—a whole cybergalaxy to explore. While the world today looks very different than it did in the days of the mainframe\, every project still needs to start at the beginning: get at least one computer to hold all project data and do all project work. So how do modern projects go from a single computer to a whole galaxy so quickly?\n\n  For many (including Tech Learning Collective!)\, the answer is Terraform\, a free\, open source\, and extensible tool that can provision and manage any number of infrastructural resources from source code repositories to cloud compute instances to DNS records and much\, much more. Using Terraform\, engineers describe the digital environment they’d like to have by writing it down in a simple\, declarative configuration language called HCL. Then\, when instructed\, Terraform does the work of metaphorically\, well\, terraforming cyberspace to match the engineer’s description.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of how to set up Terraform for your organization. We’ll also go over best practices for ensuring testing\, staging\, and production infrastructures stay isolated from one another\, how to compose reusable modules\, and how to share your Terraform configurations as well as project state with collaborators. At the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand how to bring the cloud down to earth.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters\, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet\, make censored websites available again\, and even let you host your own Internet services for free\, all without opening a single port on your firewall!\n\n  In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication\, target service load balancing\, and NAT-punching. In the process\, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class\, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone\; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie\, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of website security auditing in this hands-on workshop that will introduce you to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free\, open source Web application security scanner and intercepting proxy. We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process\, you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  According to Douglas Crockford\, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that\, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place\, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken\, hacked\, and exploited? Of course\, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break into (or\, break out of) that system.\n\n  The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites\, identifying vulnerabilities\, and exploiting them. By using the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free and open source Web application security scanner\, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics\, intercepting proxy configuration\, target scoping\, and more. We’ll be targeting the OWASP Juice Shop\, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the OWASP Top Ten. They include SQL injection\, sensitive data exposure\, cross-site scripting (XSS)\, broken authentication and access control\, and many others.\n\n  Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground\, economically\, militarily\, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way\, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do\, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords\, install malware on your systems\, or penetrate your network.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The most common way hackers steal passwords\, install malware on a victim’s computer\, or get employees to grant them unauthorized access to critical business systems is through so-called phishing attacks. A phishing attack is surprisingly low-tech\, which is part of what makes it so devastatingly effective. Learning to spot these attacks is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself online\, since a hacker’s tricks\, called “lures\,” can appear anywhere from an email\, to a Facebook message\, to a real Web site that looks exactly like one you recognize! In this workshop\, you’ll learn how frighteningly easy it is to build these scam sites\, and all about the tricks they use to fool you into falling for them.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Whether it’s corporate espionage\, ransomware\, or online fraud\, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits\, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because\, much like baiting a lure\, they won’t work unless you bite. However\, many people do get caught up by them.\n\n  In 2019\, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam\, costing businesses over $12 billion in losses. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today\, with one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month. Thankfully\, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.\n\n  For example\, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings\, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and offered to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios\, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company\, home\, or organization’s network.\n\n  In this workshop\, derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course\, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen\, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site\, email\, or other online scam.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:To take full advantage of the Web\, especially as a digital publishing medium\, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML\, the HyperText Markup Language\, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures\, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online\, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why\, then\, is it so rarely explained in terms of the language that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar\, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end\, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language\, and that includes HTML.\n\n  This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice\, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course\, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa\, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find\, use\, and most importantly understand what you’re saying.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Knowing what’s happening on the computers you’re responsible for is a critical part of knowing how to care for and maintain any IT infrastructure. Learn how to automatically monitor and alert on operational issues such as resource exhaustion before they take down your servers and applications. In this workshop\, you’ll learn about the “four golden signals” of observability\, you’ll be introduced to time series databases and metrics collection with Prometheus\, and you’ll learn how to create beautiful charts and graphs from that data with Grafana. Together\, these free\, industry-standard tools comprise the foundation of all modern and cloud-native IT monitoring stacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every computer program needs certain resources to operate well\, like memory and disk space and CPU cycles. This is true both for simple programs on your laptop and also for complex\, cloud-native systems like those that run in massive compute clusters in public cloud or on-premises datacenters. On a single computer\, tools like the Activity Monitor on macOS or the Task Manager on Windows can report which applications are taking up what amount of specific resources on your computer in near real-time\, helping you keep watch over your digital domain. When you need to monitor whole fleets of servers\, though\, you need tools that can scrape or collect the same information from those servers over a network.\n\n  In decades past\, IT teams were often limited to static data sets to perform tasks like asset tracking. As applications grew more complex\, performance and reliability metrics became increasingly important\, so instrumentation\, profiling\, and visualization tools like dedicated health and readiness checks and flame charts were developed to help engineers figure out how to both optimize the code they wrote and how to integrate it with other systems more seamlessly. Today\, specialized frameworks and burgeoning standards like OpenTelemetry are designed to give system operators more visibility into both the current and historical usage trends and patterns of the resources their services need to run well. Equipped with this information\, they can make better capacity planning decisions for the future or even help identify anomalous events like security breaches\, bugs in code\, and other subtle issues that might be hard or impossible to track down otherwise.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to the concepts and practices of observability for infrastructure at any level of scale. You’ll learn about the “four golden signals”—latency\, traffic\, errors\, and saturation—and why they matter. Like the four Quarters that are called to cast a magical circle\, each golden signal has a particular focus and almost elemental meaning. You’ll learn how to install and configure Prometheus\, the open\, industry-standard metrics collection solution on which many commercial offerings are based\, along with its accompanying components like Alertmanager\, metric exporters\, and supplemental software like Grafana that can query Prometheus’s time series database to reveal trends\, patterns\, or anomalies in your systems’ stability over time. Finally\, to make sense of all this data\, you’ll get an introduction to PromQL\, the purpose-built Prometheus Query Language used for everything from triggering alerts to making custom queries so you’ll always be able to know exactly what’s going on in your infrastructure when you need to.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The way some hypermedia object\, like a Web page\, presents itself is encoded using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features\, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop\, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials\, like how to understand the concept of document flow\, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size\, position\, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling\, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries\, modern layout modules\, and other CSS capabilities.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  All physical mediums like print\, music\, or film can be beautiful\, but they will always be constrained by the fact of their analog nature. Digital media—and specifically hypermedia—is different. It can change both its form and its function\, simultaneously presenting itself as any one or a combination of multimedia formats without changing its underlying structure. The humble Web page is a good example: it can stretch to fit your screen when viewed in a Web browser\, lay itself out on a page to prepare for being printed\, and even embed voice cues so it can be more easily listened to when read aloud. All of this is done using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\, one of the most powerful\, and most often misused\, features of the modern Web.\n\n  Although the CSS language itself is decades old now\, its origins are even older. Rooted in the idea that form and function can simultaneously coexist in a multitude of different arrangements\, CSS makes it possible for a single well-formed digital object to appear in the “best” way to any given viewer (or reader\, or listener). This is a radical departure from physical media\, like paper\, and it requires an equally radical departure from some traditional graphic design paradigms that demands we spend an equal amount of time exploring philosophical issues like “the eye of the beholder” as it demands that we familiarize ourselves with technical implementation details such as the mathematical equations determining when\, where\, and how to draw specific shapes or colors.\n\n  This workshop builds on the concepts of hypertext introduced in Tech Learning Collective’s “The Web as a Language” workshop by speaking of fundamental CSS concepts often omitted from other tutorials\, such as “User Agents\,” document flow\, and rendering contexts. You’ll learn how both the design and the function of your digital creations can benefit from approaching hypermedia more fluidly\, so you can work with the CSS rendering engine in most modern graphical programming environments rather than fighting against it. Like water\, your Web pages\, apps\, and other hypertextual creations will be able to flow seamlessly into vessels of any shape\, Operating System\, or Web Browser vendor.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language\,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably\, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g.\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API)\, develop PC games (using GDevelop)\, and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser\, office job\, or your own project.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Over the course of ten days in 1995\, the Web changed forever when Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape\, Inc. and developed a programming language that could be embedded in Web pages. Briefly named LiveScript\, the language became known as JavaScript three months later\, and was officially standardized as ECMAScript in 1997 after taking the Internet by storm only two years later. Today\, JavaScript is arguably the single most popular and prolific high-level language available to many people for many projects.\n\n  Although most people know of JavaScript as the programming language of the Web\, where its capabilities have increased dramatically over the years\, many other environments outside of the Web browser or traditional Web application now embed or rely on JavaScript engines to work. Entire back-end applications can be created with “server-side JavaScript” (Node.js\, RingoJS)\; Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices like sensors and larger microcontrollers offer JavaScript scriptable interfaces (Espruino\, low.js)\; mundane office jobs and “paperwork” can be accomplished in JavaScript (OpenOffice/LibreOffice Script Provider\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office JavaScript API)\; JavaScript can be used to write smart contracts for blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies (Hyperledger Fabric)\; desktop and PC game programming can be done entirely in JavaScript (GDevelop\, Babylon.js)\; some other programming languages are implemented in JavaScript (Scratch)\; and JavaScript can even be used for macOS system automation tasks using the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) JavaScript for Automation extension. Almost no other programming language is as easy to learn while offering the breadth of options that JavaScript does\, which is one clear reason for the language’s popularity among developers and desirability among employers.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment. By focusing on the language’s built-in constructs\, you’ll be able to avoid many common pitfalls and understand what makes JavaScript tick. We’ll cover some programming basics common to all languages\, but we’ll also show how JavaScript’s unusual rules (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) make it possible to write especially elegant—or especially dangerous—code\, as well as showing you why developing even minimal proficiency with JavaScript will drastically increase your “digital dexterity” as you browse the Web.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to provide file sharing services by creating your own networked file server so that your family\, friends\, or colleagues have a private place to save\, share\, and work on documents or photos together. Maintaining the humble file server is among the most fundamental Information Technology (IT) department tasks in businesses or organizations big and small because most other activities revolve around document storage and retrieval. In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises\, like NFS\, SMB\, and WebDAV.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As early as 1964\, computer makers like IBM\, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course\, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office\,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably\, secured properly\, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.\n\n  These days\, however\, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized\, individuals\, community groups\, political organizers\, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, Microsoft Office 365\, and Dropbox Paper come in\, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud\,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age\, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free\, Libre\, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself\, for a small group of friends\, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder\,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like WebDAV to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents\, Excel spreadsheets\, and PDFs\, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like Nextcloud. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called Network-Attached Storage (NAS) devices like the (Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that are common in Web hosting environments\, and the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols that are common in homes and offices.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Ever work on a project with other people? Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer\, novelist\, or art designer.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As most of us know first-hand\, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here\, trimming a little bit there\, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file\, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice\, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?\n\n  This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track\, compare\, and merge different versions of the same project\, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times\, across any number of files. Moreover\, by naming different snapshots\, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others\; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a branch) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of Git\, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like GitHub are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers\, Git is also useful for novelists\, researchers\, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Down the Rabbit Hole: Anonymous Publishing on the Darknet

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get your message out without revealing who you are by publishing anonymously on the “Darknet.” This workshop shows you how to create Tor Onion services for Web sites through free tools like OnionShare\, and even by setting up Tor servers that are built and configured from scratch manually. You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online\, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass\, fingerprint correlation\, and other similar attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth\, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes\, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations\, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing\, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or\, if you’re really skilled\, completely anonymously.\n\n  Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet\, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook\, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings\, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies\, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals\, and so too do politically vocal bloggers\, investigative journalists\, and citizens.\n\n  In this specialized workshop\, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road\, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times\, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services\, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers\, network relays\, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
