DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Knowing what’s happening on the computers you’re responsible for is a critical part of knowing how to care for and maintain any IT infrastructure. Learn how to automatically monitor and alert on operational issues such as resource exhaustion before they take down your servers and applications. In this workshop\, you’ll learn about the “four golden signals” of observability\, you’ll be introduced to time series databases and metrics collection with Prometheus\, and you’ll learn how to create beautiful charts and graphs from that data with Grafana. Together\, these free\, industry-standard tools comprise the foundation of all modern and cloud-native IT monitoring stacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every computer program needs certain resources to operate well\, like memory and disk space and CPU cycles. This is true both for simple programs on your laptop and also for complex\, cloud-native systems like those that run in massive compute clusters in public cloud or on-premises datacenters. On a single computer\, tools like the Activity Monitor on macOS or the Task Manager on Windows can report which applications are taking up what amount of specific resources on your computer in near real-time\, helping you keep watch over your digital domain. When you need to monitor whole fleets of servers\, though\, you need tools that can scrape or collect the same information from those servers over a network.\n\n  In decades past\, IT teams were often limited to static data sets to perform tasks like asset tracking. As applications grew more complex\, performance and reliability metrics became increasingly important\, so instrumentation\, profiling\, and visualization tools like dedicated health and readiness checks and flame charts were developed to help engineers figure out how to both optimize the code they wrote and how to integrate it with other systems more seamlessly. Today\, specialized frameworks and burgeoning standards like OpenTelemetry are designed to give system operators more visibility into both the current and historical usage trends and patterns of the resources their services need to run well. Equipped with this information\, they can make better capacity planning decisions for the future or even help identify anomalous events like security breaches\, bugs in code\, and other subtle issues that might be hard or impossible to track down otherwise.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to the concepts and practices of observability for infrastructure at any level of scale. You’ll learn about the “four golden signals”—latency\, traffic\, errors\, and saturation—and why they matter. Like the four Quarters that are called to cast a magical circle\, each golden signal has a particular focus and almost elemental meaning. You’ll learn how to install and configure Prometheus\, the open\, industry-standard metrics collection solution on which many commercial offerings are based\, along with its accompanying components like Alertmanager\, metric exporters\, and supplemental software like Grafana that can query Prometheus’s time series database to reveal trends\, patterns\, or anomalies in your systems’ stability over time. Finally\, to make sense of all this data\, you’ll get an introduction to PromQL\, the purpose-built Prometheus Query Language used for everything from triggering alerts to making custom queries so you’ll always be able to know exactly what’s going on in your infrastructure when you need to.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The way some hypermedia object\, like a Web page\, presents itself is encoded using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features\, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop\, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials\, like how to understand the concept of document flow\, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size\, position\, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling\, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries\, modern layout modules\, and other CSS capabilities.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  All physical mediums like print\, music\, or film can be beautiful\, but they will always be constrained by the fact of their analog nature. Digital media—and specifically hypermedia—is different. It can change both its form and its function\, simultaneously presenting itself as any one or a combination of multimedia formats without changing its underlying structure. The humble Web page is a good example: it can stretch to fit your screen when viewed in a Web browser\, lay itself out on a page to prepare for being printed\, and even embed voice cues so it can be more easily listened to when read aloud. All of this is done using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\, one of the most powerful\, and most often misused\, features of the modern Web.\n\n  Although the CSS language itself is decades old now\, its origins are even older. Rooted in the idea that form and function can simultaneously coexist in a multitude of different arrangements\, CSS makes it possible for a single well-formed digital object to appear in the “best” way to any given viewer (or reader\, or listener). This is a radical departure from physical media\, like paper\, and it requires an equally radical departure from some traditional graphic design paradigms that demands we spend an equal amount of time exploring philosophical issues like “the eye of the beholder” as it demands that we familiarize ourselves with technical implementation details such as the mathematical equations determining when\, where\, and how to draw specific shapes or colors.\n\n  This workshop builds on the concepts of hypertext introduced in Tech Learning Collective’s “The Web as a Language” workshop by speaking of fundamental CSS concepts often omitted from other tutorials\, such as “User Agents\,” document flow\, and rendering contexts. You’ll learn how both the design and the function of your digital creations can benefit from approaching hypermedia more fluidly\, so you can work with the CSS rendering engine in most modern graphical programming environments rather than fighting against it. Like water\, your Web pages\, apps\, and other hypertextual creations will be able to flow seamlessly into vessels of any shape\, Operating System\, or Web Browser vendor.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to beat back configuration drift on your servers by leveraging automation tools like Ansible in this deep dive workshop demonstrating modern DevOps practices for deploying\, maintaining\, and auditing compute clusters. Whether for a Web application\, big data processing\, or other project\, you need to turn old-school runbooks into computerized playbooks that can execute Standard Operating Procedures quickly and reliably so you can deploy complex systems simply and predictably. Come learn about key concepts like idempotence and change control\, and learn how giant corporations implement security principles like RBAC\, all using free and open source software.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Today\, all but the most trivial of computer systems rely on an interdependent set of servers working in concert. You don’t just have one server\, you have a group of them. Commonly called a cluster\, these servers need to be managed as a group\, ensuring that their software configurations\, security patches\, and installed packages are deployed\, maintained\, and eventually updated or retired in a predictable way.\n\n  In this deep dive workshop\, we’ll set up our own small cluster and use Ansible\, which is an agentless\, cross-platform\, enterprise-grade\, free software Configuration Management (CM) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework used by giant corporations like IBM and Cisco\, to turn old-school operator runbooks into computerized playbooks that can be executed quickly and easily even by novice operators. Through several hands-on exercises\, you’ll learn about the entire CM lifecycle from planning through auditing so that you understand critical CM concepts like idempotence\, change control\, and more\, which are common to all CM systems including Chef\, Puppet\, and Salt.\n\n  Along the way\, you’ll be exposed to key concepts such as containerization through Ansible’s support for automating container builds\, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Ansible’s AWX Project\, and more. By adopting configuration management workflows with tools like Ansible\, you can reduce operator errors\, and beat back configuration drift on any long-lived infrastructure components.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to pack up your code bases\, apps\, and microservices and get ready to set sail aboard container orchestration platforms in the cloud or on your own metal in this introductory workshop about working with containers. Far from a newfangled buzzword\, containerizing digital workloads have precedents dating back to the invention of the UNIX operating system in the 1970’s. Today\, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills\, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are\, where they came from\, and how to best use them for DevOps\, site reliability\, and even enhanced security tasks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the earliest days of computing\, an application would be responsible for processing only very small amounts of input. It would then produce a similarly small amount of output\, working as fast and efficiently as possible. Known as a processing “pipeline\,” this early solutions paradigm is most famously expressed as the so-called “UNIX philosophy\,” a programmer’s adage that states each program should “do (only) one thing\, and do it well\,” and it’s still the beating heart of powerful computer interfaces such as command line use to this day.\n\n  Then\, all throughout the 1980’s\, 90’s\, and 2000’s\, as computing speed relentlessly increased while its cost simultaneously plummeted\, companies began building larger\, more complex applications. Known as “monoliths\,” this generation of apps were well-suited for their environment\, where they were deployed onto singular mainframe-like computers housed inside private server rooms. But these application architectures are no longer sensible in a world where cloud computing and virtualization technologies make it possible to dynamically reserve compute power as user demand ebbs and flows. Why over-purchase server hardware when you can spin up another virtual machine to handle a spike in traffic\, then automatically have that machine shut itself down when incoming requests settle back at manageable levels?\n\n  That’s one reason why\, today\, online apps from Google\, Facebook\, and others are written as “microservices.” Far from being worthy of the buzzword-driven hype\, this paradigm is actually a return to software’s original designs where the goals of a larger application are processed independently by a set of cooperating but independent smaller programs\, each one performing only one job very well. To make this work in today’s cloud environments\, each microservice must be “containerized\,” packaged into a single Operating System process that is run by a container management engine such as Docker\, CoreOS’s rkt (pronounced “rocket”)\, or LXD in preparation for being orchestrated across a fleet of hundreds or thousands of (often virtual) compute instances.\n\n  In this hands-on workshop\, you’ll learn how to make use of the thousands of ready-made containers available at container registries such as the Docker Hub\, create new containers from scratch\, containerize existing codebases\, manage running containers\, and more. We’ll explore how to troubleshoot container failures\, show how to network multiple containers together\, and touch on container orchestration tools like Docker’s Swarm mode\, HashiCorp Nomad\, Apache Mesos/Marathon\, and Kubernetes to see how our containers can be automatically distributed\, or “scheduled\,” and be tasked with their specialized workloads across a virtual private cloud based on whatever resources we have available to us.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop is a practical introduction to creating\, using\, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before\, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity\, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software\, and much more!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so\, no matter what you’re doing on your computer\, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example\, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes\, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing\, or “containerizing\,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.\n\n  Today\, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers\, servers\, and global data networks work\, and cross-platform\, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by VeraCrypt)\, network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g.\, using VLANs) or even the whole Internet (using INetSim)\, processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g.\, in QEMU)\, and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by Proxmox). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features\, such as in the Qubes Operating System\, macOS’s App Sandbox\, and Firefox Containers.\n\n  Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit\, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the VirtualBox type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly\, browse the Web more safely\, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers\, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure\, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems\, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist\, like inception\, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language\,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably\, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g.\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API)\, develop PC games (using GDevelop)\, and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser\, office job\, or your own project.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Over the course of ten days in 1995\, the Web changed forever when Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape\, Inc. and developed a programming language that could be embedded in Web pages. Briefly named LiveScript\, the language became known as JavaScript three months later\, and was officially standardized as ECMAScript in 1997 after taking the Internet by storm only two years later. Today\, JavaScript is arguably the single most popular and prolific high-level language available to many people for many projects.\n\n  Although most people know of JavaScript as the programming language of the Web\, where its capabilities have increased dramatically over the years\, many other environments outside of the Web browser or traditional Web application now embed or rely on JavaScript engines to work. Entire back-end applications can be created with “server-side JavaScript” (Node.js\, RingoJS)\; Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices like sensors and larger microcontrollers offer JavaScript scriptable interfaces (Espruino\, low.js)\; mundane office jobs and “paperwork” can be accomplished in JavaScript (OpenOffice/LibreOffice Script Provider\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office JavaScript API)\; JavaScript can be used to write smart contracts for blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies (Hyperledger Fabric)\; desktop and PC game programming can be done entirely in JavaScript (GDevelop\, Babylon.js)\; some other programming languages are implemented in JavaScript (Scratch)\; and JavaScript can even be used for macOS system automation tasks using the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) JavaScript for Automation extension. Almost no other programming language is as easy to learn while offering the breadth of options that JavaScript does\, which is one clear reason for the language’s popularity among developers and desirability among employers.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment. By focusing on the language’s built-in constructs\, you’ll be able to avoid many common pitfalls and understand what makes JavaScript tick. We’ll cover some programming basics common to all languages\, but we’ll also show how JavaScript’s unusual rules (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) make it possible to write especially elegant—or especially dangerous—code\, as well as showing you why developing even minimal proficiency with JavaScript will drastically increase your “digital dexterity” as you browse the Web.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to provide file sharing services by creating your own networked file server so that your family\, friends\, or colleagues have a private place to save\, share\, and work on documents or photos together. Maintaining the humble file server is among the most fundamental Information Technology (IT) department tasks in businesses or organizations big and small because most other activities revolve around document storage and retrieval. In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises\, like NFS\, SMB\, and WebDAV.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As early as 1964\, computer makers like IBM\, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course\, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office\,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably\, secured properly\, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.\n\n  These days\, however\, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized\, individuals\, community groups\, political organizers\, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, Microsoft Office 365\, and Dropbox Paper come in\, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud\,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age\, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free\, Libre\, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself\, for a small group of friends\, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder\,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like WebDAV to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents\, Excel spreadsheets\, and PDFs\, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like Nextcloud. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called Network-Attached Storage (NAS) devices like the (Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that are common in Web hosting environments\, and the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols that are common in homes and offices.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of securing digital infrastructure by taking a deep-dive into the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\, a fundamental component of safe administrative access to remote servers. Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations\, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up\, access\, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself\, friends\, or comrades.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every app you use—from messengers like Signal or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like WordPress and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and online maps—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone)\, or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”)\, no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services\, somewhere. So\, do you know where your servers are? If not\, you can’t know how safe your data is!\n\n  When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there\, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar\, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned\, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation\, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.\n\n  This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration\, Networking\, and Security courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup\, monitoring\, and maintenance. By taking a deep dive into the SSH protocol\, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way\, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers\, Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks\, and much more. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself\, your friends\, and your comrades\, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS\, Windows\, BSD\, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like iptables\, nft\, and pfctl)\, you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks\, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences\, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools including dedicated firewall distributions (like pfSense and IPFire) as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers\, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works\, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort and Suricata.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s ubiquitous computing environment\, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its network connection. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware\, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration\, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus\, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router\, just about every computer has a firewall these days\, including your personal laptop.\n\n  Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology\, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time\, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks\, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).\n\n  But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called Netfilter and controlled with the iptables or nft commands) is the backbone of many commercial enterprise firewall distributions\, and it’s available free of charge. Plus\, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as Docker’s networking and Kubernetes’s kube-proxy\, among others.\n\n  So\, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows\, macOS\, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers\, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices\, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\, and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can help you evade Internet censorship\, protect your network traffic\, and offer easier access to remote services on firewalled internal networks. You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN\, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution\, so that you can connect securely to your home\, office\, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are\, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How often have you wished you could be in two places at once? That’s exactly what Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology was designed to allow computers to do. First popularized in 1996 by Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)\, using VPN technology made it possible for two disconnected networks to be knit back together into one as long as each of them were connected to a third middle network\, even if that middle network was hostile or untrusted. Today\, that middle network is usually the Internet\, which can certainly be hostile and untrusted! With a VPN\, it’s possible to be “here” (on your actual network) and “there” (on the other side of the VPN connection) at the same time\; by signing into a VPN service\, you create a “VPN tunnel” that acts like a wormhole in space-time in that whatever you send into the tunnel emerges on the other side as though the two sides of the tunnel are next to each other.\n\n  Throughout the late 1990’s and 2000’s\, VPN technology saw a surge in use among businesses looking for ways to enable remote workers. Using VPNs made it simpler for a colleague to travel because they could still be “directly connected” to their office network. By 2001\, the OpenVPN project made this amazing technology free and open source for GNU/Linux systems\, with cross-platform implementations for Mac OS X and Windows arriving shortly thereafter. Today\, OpenVPN servers form the bedrock of many modern free and commercial VPN solutions\, and are still the most widely deployed VPN solution for most use cases.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get to see what happens when network packets are sent into VPN tunnels and how they appear on the other side in order to learn exactly how VPNs encapsulate—and secure—your computer’s communication with Web sites\, office servers\, or other services. You’ll see what it takes to set up your own OpenVPN server (not much!)\, as well as how to troubleshoot connection issues. You’ll also get introduced to several newer but less mature VPN protocols such as Wireguard\, and learn about Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions such as IPsec and its related tunneling (L2TP) and security (ESP\, IKE\, etcetera) protocols.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Ever work on a project with other people? Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer\, novelist\, or art designer.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As most of us know first-hand\, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here\, trimming a little bit there\, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file\, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice\, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?\n\n  This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track\, compare\, and merge different versions of the same project\, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times\, across any number of files. Moreover\, by naming different snapshots\, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others\; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a branch) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of Git\, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like GitHub are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers\, Git is also useful for novelists\, researchers\, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get your message out without revealing who you are by publishing anonymously on the “Darknet.” This workshop shows you how to create Tor Onion services for Web sites through free tools like OnionShare\, and even by setting up Tor servers that are built and configured from scratch manually. You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online\, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass\, fingerprint correlation\, and other similar attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth\, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes\, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations\, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing\, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or\, if you’re really skilled\, completely anonymously.\n\n  Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet\, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook\, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings\, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies\, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals\, and so too do politically vocal bloggers\, investigative journalists\, and citizens.\n\n  In this specialized workshop\, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road\, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times\, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services\, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers\, network relays\, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic\, such as Web browsing\, email\, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic\, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as google.com in our Web browser?\n\n  The answer lies in DNS\, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book\,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983\, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system\, the DNS is actually a massive\, distributed\, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of resource records (RRs). For instance\, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like SPF\, DKIM\, DMARC\, and DANE\, and CAA resource records)\, perform service discovery (with SRV records)\, and more.\n\n  Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial\, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop\, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself\, watching queries and replies\, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers\, called resolvers\, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the zone in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic\, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as DNSCrypt v2\, DNS-over-TLS (DoT)\, and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\, which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come exploring with us as we show you how to map out interconnections between computers\, trace packet routes across network gateways\, and find information about network operators. In this workshop all about the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments\, we use tools like nmap to send probes into cyberspace and tap into the wire with Wireshark to understand how they function.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace\, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace\, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!\n\n  These are the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way\, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices\, such as routers\, firewalls\, traffic inspectors\, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey\, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next\, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as nmap along with digital wiretapping tools like Wireshark we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.\n\n  Join us to explore strange new networks\, to seek out new devices and new organizations\, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers\, hidden away behind locked doors\, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly\, others scary\, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages\, the command line\, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  To be useful\, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically\, the way you can control a computer is called a user interface because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is\, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs\, which are the buttons\, windows\, and other controls that you can point-and-click on\, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your pointer or mouse cursor) and\, worse\, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI\, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse\, you cannot manipulate it.\n\n  This is why almost all hackers\, programmers\, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many\, if not most\, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line\, or “terminal\,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover\, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time\, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer\, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders\, processing text\, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language\, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:BitTorrent\, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol\, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers\, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology\, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard\, Inc. use it every day\, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own\, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet\,” you probably heard of BitTorrent or its more colloquial synonym\, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans\, financial penalties\, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns\, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard\, immoral\, and unsafe to use\, but the reality is far less one-sided.\n\n  BitTorrent refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network\, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior\, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover\, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products\, such as Blizzard\, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company)\, who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players.\n\n  Today\, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular\, cost-efficient\, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills\, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like ZeroNet are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before\, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g.\, PeerTube) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called WebTorrent to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.\n\n  In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find\, download\, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends\, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption\, connecting to trackers through public proxies and Virtual Private Networks\, and building private seedboxes.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You don’t need to have your doctorate in theoretical mathematics to understand crypto enough to use it safely\, but you do need to use it safely to be secure! Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations\, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical\, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography\, stream and block ciphers\, digital signatures\, one-way hash functions\, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)\, and more.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every time you use a modern computer\, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root\, these functions\, called cryptographic primitives\, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices\, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works\, from password vaults to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to BitCoin and beyond.\n\n  Today\, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free\, even if they don’t realize it. Signal Private Messenger’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The Tor anonymity network? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography\, and digital signatures\, oh my)!\n\n  Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e.\, mathematical weapons\, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math\, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “Crypto Wars” in the 1990’s.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades\, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice\, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated\, practice developing your own simple ciphers\, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy)\, integrity-protection (authenticity)\, and more. By the end of this workshop\, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach\, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
