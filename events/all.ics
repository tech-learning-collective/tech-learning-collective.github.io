DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Ever wanted to peek over the shoulder of an expert developer as they write code\, to pick their brain while they solve real-life problems in real time\, or simply bask in the comfort of watching an experienced craftsperson at work? Tech Learning Collective’s “Watch and Learn” events are your chance to join our staff as they livestream some of the work they do\, such as redesigning our Web site\, building out new or upgrading old infrastructure\, and performing other (non-sensitive) tasks to keep Tech Learning Collective moving forward. It’s like watching Bob Ross paint\, if he were painting with bits and bytes.\n\nLivestream Topic\n\n\n  Tech Learning Collective is redesigning our Web site for 2021. In a few months\, we’ll launch a brand new custom Web design for our public-facing Web site. We’ll have new colors\, new layouts\, and most importantly new code. So this Watch and Learn event will be focused almost exclusively on front-end Web development.\n\n  Some of the work has already been done\, but there’s lots more to do. Our Web designer will be streaming the way they start by examining graphic design artifacts from the Free Software GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)\, a powerful alternative to Adobe Photoshop\, translating them into liquid and dynamic layouts so that they work in a variety of Web browser makes\, models\, and sizes\, and finally how they integrate the new code with our Web site’s simple Content Management System (CMS) called Jekyll. Along the way\, you’ll get to see how an experienced front-end Web designer thinks about design elements like layout grids\, how they organize and optimize Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code\, and how rich metadata in the form of semantic HTML markup makes their job easier.\n\n  By attending\, you get a front-row seat to the video livestream\, along with access to a chat channel where you can ask questions about and offer feedback on the coding process live and in real time. We recommend that you have at least some familiarity with basic HTML and CSS code\, as this is not a full-fledged class or workshop.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal\, a free\, secure\, private message app is simple enough to schedule drinks with\, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed\, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action\, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset\, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies\, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.\n\n  Signal is the name of a Free Software\, secure\, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or\, more commonly\, the Double-Ratchet Algorithm\, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e.\, end-to-end encryption\, message authentication\, plausible deniability or message repudiation\, perfect forward secrecy\, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling\, location- and file-sharing features\, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!\n\n  If you’ve never heard of Signal before\, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal\, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification\, disappearing messages\, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers\, inactivity lock-outs\, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with\, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You don’t need to have your doctorate in theoretical mathematics to understand crypto enough to use it safely\, but you do need to use it safely to be secure! Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations\, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical\, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography\, stream and block ciphers\, digital signatures\, one-way hash functions\, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)\, and more.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every time you use a modern computer\, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root\, these functions\, called cryptographic primitives\, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices\, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works\, from password vaults to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to BitCoin and beyond.\n\n  Today\, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free\, even if they don’t realize it. Signal Private Messenger’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The Tor anonymity network? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography\, and digital signatures\, oh my)!\n\n  Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e.\, mathematical weapons\, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math\, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “Crypto Wars” in the 1990’s.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades\, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice\, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated\, practice developing your own simple ciphers\, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy)\, integrity-protection (authenticity)\, and more. By the end of this workshop\, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach\, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of securing digital infrastructure by taking a deep-dive into the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\, a fundamental component of safe administrative access to remote servers. Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations\, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up\, access\, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself\, friends\, or comrades.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every app you use—from messengers like Signal or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like WordPress and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and online maps—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone)\, or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”)\, no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services\, somewhere. So\, do you know where your servers are? If not\, you can’t know how safe your data is!\n\n  When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there\, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar\, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned\, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation\, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.\n\n  This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration\, Networking\, and Security courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup\, monitoring\, and maintenance. By taking a deep dive into the SSH protocol\, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way\, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers\, Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks\, and much more. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself\, your friends\, and your comrades\, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:On Sunday\, March 21st\, join Tech Learning Collective and the Free Software Foundation at the all-online LibrePlanet 2021 conference about software freedom\, where we will be delivering our talk\, “Beyond ‘Learning to Code’: How Tech Learning Collective Merges IT Training with Emancipatory Political Action.”\n\n\n  What good is a pen if the paper it touches can refuse to show its ink? What good is your app when your API key is revoked? Through metaphor and with a unique apprenticeship-based pedagogy\, Tech Learning Collective (TLC) is empowering users by doing exactly what code boot camps and corporate-funded “learn to code” programs don’t: TLC tells students to ignore new Web frameworks and focus instead on the lowest layers of an IT stack like physical network and hardware storage devices. At TLC\, infrastructure is the heart of a free software curriculum eschewing common rush-to-employment training paradigms in favor of Socratic classrooms where practicing Bash commands seamlessly meld with lectures about Gnostic influences on Ethernet\, the relationship between Gregorian chants and bootloaders\, and more. Come see why and how TLC’s holistic approach to IT education is creating communities of activist sysadmins out of people who wouldn’t otherwise have called themselves “techies.”\n\n\nLibrePlanet is a conference about software freedom\, happening March 20 through 21\, 2021. The event is hosted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)\, and brings together software developers\, law and policy experts\, activists\, students\, and computer users to learn skills\, celebrate free software accomplishments\, and face upcoming challenges. Newcomers are always welcome\, and LibrePlanet 2021 will feature programming for all ages and experience levels.\n\nTickets are required to attend the conference\; please register for LibrePlanet 2021 in advance.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop is a practical introduction to creating\, using\, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before\, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity\, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software\, and much more!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so\, no matter what you’re doing on your computer\, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example\, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes\, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing\, or “containerizing\,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.\n\n  Today\, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers\, servers\, and global data networks work\, and cross-platform\, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by VeraCrypt)\, network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g.\, using VLANs) or even the whole Internet (using INetSim)\, processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g.\, in QEMU)\, and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by Proxmox). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features\, such as in the Qubes Operating System\, macOS’s App Sandbox\, and Firefox Containers.\n\n  Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit\, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the VirtualBox type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly\, browse the Web more safely\, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers\, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure\, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems\, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist\, like inception\, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to pack up your code bases\, apps\, and microservices and get ready to set sail aboard container orchestration platforms in the cloud or on your own metal in this introductory workshop about working with containers. Far from a newfangled buzzword\, containerizing digital workloads have precedents dating back to the invention of the UNIX operating system in the 1970’s. Today\, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills\, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are\, where they came from\, and how to best use them for DevOps\, site reliability\, and even enhanced security tasks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the earliest days of computing\, an application would be responsible for processing only very small amounts of input. It would then produce a similarly small amount of output\, working as fast and efficiently as possible. Known as a processing “pipeline\,” this early solutions paradigm is most famously expressed as the so-called “UNIX philosophy\,” a programmer’s adage that states each program should “do (only) one thing\, and do it well\,” and it’s still the beating heart of powerful computer interfaces such as command line use to this day.\n\n  Then\, all throughout the 1980’s\, 90’s\, and 2000’s\, as computing speed relentlessly increased while its cost simultaneously plummeted\, companies began building larger\, more complex applications. Known as “monoliths\,” this generation of apps were well-suited for their environment\, where they were deployed onto singular mainframe-like computers housed inside private server rooms. But these application architectures are no longer sensible in a world where cloud computing and virtualization technologies make it possible to dynamically reserve compute power as user demand ebbs and flows. Why over-purchase server hardware when you can spin up another virtual machine to handle a spike in traffic\, then automatically have that machine shut itself down when incoming requests settle back at manageable levels?\n\n  That’s one reason why\, today\, online apps from Google\, Facebook\, and others are written as “microservices.” Far from being worthy of the buzzword-driven hype\, this paradigm is actually a return to software’s original designs where the goals of a larger application are processed independently by a set of cooperating but independent smaller programs\, each one performing only one job very well. To make this work in today’s cloud environments\, each microservice must be “containerized\,” packaged into a single Operating System process that is run by a container management engine such as Docker\, CoreOS’s rkt (pronounced “rocket”)\, or LXD in preparation for being orchestrated across a fleet of hundreds or thousands of (often virtual) compute instances.\n\n  In this hands-on workshop\, you’ll learn how to make use of the thousands of ready-made containers available at container registries such as the Docker Hub\, create new containers from scratch\, containerize existing codebases\, manage running containers\, and more. We’ll explore how to troubleshoot container failures\, show how to network multiple containers together\, and touch on container orchestration tools like Docker’s Swarm mode\, HashiCorp Nomad\, Apache Mesos/Marathon\, and Kubernetes to see how our containers can be automatically distributed\, or “scheduled\,” and be tasked with their specialized workloads across a virtual private cloud based on whatever resources we have available to us.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers\, hidden away behind locked doors\, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly\, others scary\, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages\, the command line\, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  To be useful\, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically\, the way you can control a computer is called a user interface because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is\, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs\, which are the buttons\, windows\, and other controls that you can point-and-click on\, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your pointer or mouse cursor) and\, worse\, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI\, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse\, you cannot manipulate it.\n\n  This is why almost all hackers\, programmers\, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many\, if not most\, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line\, or “terminal\,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover\, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time\, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer\, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders\, processing text\, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language\, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS\, Windows\, BSD\, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like iptables\, nft\, and pfctl)\, you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks\, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences\, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools including dedicated firewall distributions (like pfSense and IPFire) as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers\, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works\, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort and Suricata.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s ubiquitous computing environment\, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its network connection. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware\, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration\, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus\, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router\, just about every computer has a firewall these days\, including your personal laptop.\n\n  Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology\, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time\, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks\, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).\n\n  But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called Netfilter and controlled with the iptables or nft commands) is the backbone of many commercial enterprise firewall distributions\, and it’s available free of charge. Plus\, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as Docker’s networking and Kubernetes’s kube-proxy\, among others.\n\n  So\, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows\, macOS\, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers\, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices\, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\, and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

First popularized in 1996 by Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)\, using VPN technology made it possible for two disconnected networks to be knit back together into one as long as each of them were connected to a third middle network\, even if that middle network was hostile or untrusted. Today\, that middle network is usually the Internet\, which can certainly be hostile and untrusted! With a VPN\, it’s possible to be “here” (on your actual network) and “there” (on the other side of the VPN connection) at the same time\; by signing into a VPN service\, you create a “VPN tunnel” that acts like a wormhole in space-time in that whatever you send into the tunnel emerges on the other side as though the two sides of the tunnel are next to each other.\n\n  Throughout the late 1990’s and 2000’s\, VPN technology saw a surge in use among businesses looking for ways to enable remote workers. Using VPNs made it simpler for a colleague to travel because they could still be “directly connected” to their office network. By 2001\, the OpenVPN project made this amazing technology free and open source for GNU/Linux systems\, with cross-platform implementations for Mac OS X and Windows arriving shortly thereafter. Today\, OpenVPN servers form the bedrock of many modern free and commercial VPN solutions\, and are still the most widely deployed VPN solution for most use cases.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get to see what happens when network packets are sent into VPN tunnels and how they appear on the other side in order to learn exactly how VPNs encapsulate—and secure—your computer’s communication with Web sites\, office servers\, or other services. You’ll see what it takes to set up your own OpenVPN server (not much!)\, as well as how to troubleshoot connection issues. You’ll also get introduced to several newer but less mature VPN protocols such as Wireguard\, and learn about Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions such as IPsec and its related tunneling (L2TP) and security (ESP\, IKE\, etcetera) protocols.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how easy it is to avoid certain forms of Internet censorship\, phishing attacks\, or network outages in this primer to the Domain Name System or DNS. Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses\, the DNS is actually a massively distributed\, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers\, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers\, anti-spam DNS resource records\, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the digital world of cyperspace networks\, such as the Internet\, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic\, such as Web browsing\, email\, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic\, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as google.com in our Web browser?\n\n  The answer lies in DNS\, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book\,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983\, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system\, the DNS is actually a massive\, distributed\, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of resource records (RRs). For instance\, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like SPF\, DKIM\, DMARC\, and DANE\, and CAA resource records)\, perform service discovery (with SRV records)\, and more.\n\n  Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial\, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop\, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself\, watching queries and replies\, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers\, called resolvers\, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the zone in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic\, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as DNSCrypt v2\, DNS-over-TLS (DoT)\, and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\, which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come exploring with us as we show you how to map out interconnections between computers\, trace packet routes across network gateways\, and find information about network operators. In this workshop all about the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments\, we use tools like nmap to send probes into cyberspace and tap into the wire with Wireshark to understand how they function.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace\, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace\, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!\n\n  These are the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way\, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices\, such as routers\, firewalls\, traffic inspectors\, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey\, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next\, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as nmap along with digital wiretapping tools like Wireshark we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.\n\n  Join us to explore strange new networks\, to seek out new devices and new organizations\, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:BitTorrent\, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol\, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers\, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology\, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard\, Inc. use it every day\, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own\, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet\,” you probably heard of BitTorrent or its more colloquial synonym\, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans\, financial penalties\, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns\, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard\, immoral\, and unsafe to use\, but the reality is far less one-sided.\n\n  BitTorrent refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network\, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior\, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover\, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products\, such as Blizzard\, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company)\, who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players.\n\n  Today\, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular\, cost-efficient\, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills\, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like ZeroNet are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before\, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g.\, PeerTube) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called WebTorrent to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.\n\n  In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find\, download\, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends\, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption\, connecting to trackers through public proxies and Virtual Private Networks\, and building private seedboxes.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before\, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society\, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop\, but with global systems of law\, finance\, and even art\, literature\, and philosophy governing today’s world.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous\, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.\n\n  Modern computers are power tools\, and behind each one of them is a human operator\, or “system administrator\,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone\, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date\, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos\, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files\, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called daemons\, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors\, they make up the world of Operating System services\, signals\, sockets\, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer\, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to collect\, generate\, and manipulate data of all kinds so that you can make decisions and meet the challenges you’re facing. You’ll see how simple\, text-based data files and command-line utilities have been and are still being used in all sorts of applications today\, what spreadsheets have to offer\, and how all these tools differ from Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) like MySQL/MariaDB\, PostgreSQL\, Oracle\, or Microsoft SQL Server. This workshop will also touch on Web scraping\, form building\, mail merges\, data cleaning\, and other techniques you need to know to make automating the boring parts of your day possible.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If knowledge is power\, what is knowledge? On a computer\, knowledge comes from data. By collecting data relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve\, you can scrutinize it in various different ways until you’re able to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset\; you turn data into information\, and from that information you gain knowledge\, which gives you power. But this is all much easier said than done\, especially if you are not already familiar with how to work with digital data.\n\n  This workshop introduces you to the concepts and techniques you need to know to collect\, generate\, and manipulate digital information regardless of the specific application or problem domain you’re working in. Ever since the dawn of computing\, data has been a central element in computer use. After all\, what good is a computer without data to compute? Early databases took the form of stacks of physical punch cards. Later on\, databases were created out of structured text files (and many of these still exist on your computer today\, whether you realize it or not). With the advent of “personal” computing in the 1980’s\, digital spreadsheets in applications like Lotus 1-2-3 brought enterprise automation solutions to the masses—or it would have\, if more people had the opportunity to learn how to use these powerful tools.\n\n  Today\, massive datasets with billions or trillions of records are often stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) and are accessed using specialized computer languages such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). These databases are thus the crown jewels of every company or organization conducting business online. Everything that matters to them gets stored in a database of some kind\, from email subscriber lists\, customer records\, call logs\, and purchase orders\, to social media postings\, blog comments\, personal photos\, and much more. Practice working with different kinds of data to learn the foundations relevant to all data exploration and transformation tasks in this introductory workshop that will help you ensure you can get the right stuff to construct successful solutions to any problem.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
