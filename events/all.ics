DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before\, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society\, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop\, but with global systems of law\, finance\, and even art\, literature\, and philosophy governing today’s world.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous\, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.\n\n  Modern computers are power tools\, and behind each one of them is a human operator\, or “system administrator\,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone\, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date\, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos\, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files\, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called daemons\, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors\, they make up the world of Operating System services\, signals\, sockets\, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer\, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters\, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet\, make censored websites available again\, and even let you host your own Internet services for free\, all without opening a single port on your firewall!\n\n  In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication\, target service load balancing\, and NAT-punching. In the process\, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class\, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone\; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie\, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The Imitation Game: Introduction to Administering Virtual Machine Systems

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop is a practical introduction to creating\, using\, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before\, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity\, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software\, and much more!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so\, no matter what you’re doing on your computer\, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example\, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes\, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing\, or “containerizing\,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.\n\n  Today\, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers\, servers\, and global data networks work\, and cross-platform\, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by VeraCrypt)\, network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g.\, using VLANs) or even the whole Internet (using INetSim)\, processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g.\, in QEMU)\, and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by Proxmox). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features\, such as in the Qubes Operating System\, macOS’s App Sandbox\, and Firefox Containers.\n\n  Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit\, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the VirtualBox type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly\, browse the Web more safely\, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers\, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure\, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems\, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist\, like inception\, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to inscribe your thoughts\, dreams\, and desires into your computer and take your command line skills to the next level by learning how to write simple programs called shell scripts. In a way\, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively\, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs\, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  At their core\, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper\, they allow us to record our thoughts\, dreams\, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper\, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible\, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors\, industrial control systems\, biomedical devices\, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.\n\n  When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer\, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose\, text-only interface called a command line. Individually\, these instructions are called invocations. (Yes\, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to write whole spells\, rituals\, or (sacred) texts called shell scripts to inscribe your own thoughts\, dreams\, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.\n\n  By saving your scripts in files\, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and\, as such\, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work\, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in\, how to find out if you have been “pwned\,” what the risks are\, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force\, credential stuffing\, and other forms of account takeover attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you been “pwned”? For years\, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at HaveIBeenPwned.com that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is\, if your personal information such as your password\, has been leaked\, accessed\, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on\, check for yourself!\n\n  If you’ve been “pwned\,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be\, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course\, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.\n\n\n\n  Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them\, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side\, learn professional techniques for recovering passwords from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation\, such as using optimized wordlists\, word-mangling rulesets\, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).
