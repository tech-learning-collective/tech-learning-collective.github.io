DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters\, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet\, make censored websites available again\, and even let you host your own Internet services for free\, all without opening a single port on your firewall!\n\n  In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication\, target service load balancing\, and NAT-punching. In the process\, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class\, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone\; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie\, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Ever work on a project with other people? Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer\, novelist\, or art designer.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As most of us know first-hand\, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here\, trimming a little bit there\, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file\, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice\, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?\n\n  This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track\, compare\, and merge different versions of the same project\, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times\, across any number of files. Moreover\, by naming different snapshots\, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others\; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a branch) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of Git\, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like GitHub are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers\, Git is also useful for novelists\, researchers\, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS\, Windows\, BSD\, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like iptables\, nft\, and pfctl)\, you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks\, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences\, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools including dedicated firewall distributions (like pfSense and IPFire) as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers\, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works\, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort and Suricata.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s ubiquitous computing environment\, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its network connection. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware\, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration\, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus\, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router\, just about every computer has a firewall these days\, including your personal laptop.\n\n  Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology\, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time\, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks\, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).\n\n  But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called Netfilter and controlled with the iptables or nft commands) is the backbone of many commercial enterprise firewall distributions\, and it’s available free of charge. Plus\, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as Docker’s networking and Kubernetes’s kube-proxy\, among others.\n\n  So\, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows\, macOS\, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers\, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices\, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\, and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of website security auditing in this hands-on workshop that will introduce you to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free\, open source Web application security scanner and intercepting proxy. We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process\, you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  According to Douglas Crockford\, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that\, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place\, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken\, hacked\, and exploited? Of course\, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break into (or\, break out of) that system.\n\n  The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites\, identifying vulnerabilities\, and exploiting them. By using the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free and open source Web application security scanner\, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics\, intercepting proxy configuration\, target scoping\, and more. We’ll be targeting the OWASP Juice Shop\, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the OWASP Top Ten. They include SQL injection\, sensitive data exposure\, cross-site scripting (XSS)\, broken authentication and access control\, and many others.\n\n  Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground\, economically\, militarily\, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way\, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do\, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords\, install malware on your systems\, or penetrate your network.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to pack up your code bases\, apps\, and microservices and get ready to set sail aboard container orchestration platforms in the cloud or on your own metal in this introductory workshop about working with containers. Far from a newfangled buzzword\, containerizing digital workloads have precedents dating back to the invention of the UNIX operating system in the 1970’s. Today\, operating container engines like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are increasingly essential skills\, but difficult to navigate. This workshop will put you back on course by providing a ground-up view of what containers really are\, where they came from\, and how to best use them for DevOps\, site reliability\, and even enhanced security tasks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the earliest days of computing\, an application would be responsible for processing only very small amounts of input. It would then produce a similarly small amount of output\, working as fast and efficiently as possible. Known as a processing “pipeline\,” this early solutions paradigm is most famously expressed as the so-called “UNIX philosophy\,” a programmer’s adage that states each program should “do (only) one thing\, and do it well\,” and it’s still the beating heart of powerful computer interfaces such as command line use to this day.\n\n  Then\, all throughout the 1980’s\, 90’s\, and 2000’s\, as computing speed relentlessly increased while its cost simultaneously plummeted\, companies began building larger\, more complex applications. Known as “monoliths\,” this generation of apps were well-suited for their environment\, where they were deployed onto singular mainframe-like computers housed inside private server rooms. But these application architectures are no longer sensible in a world where cloud computing and virtualization technologies make it possible to dynamically reserve compute power as user demand ebbs and flows. Why over-purchase server hardware when you can spin up another virtual machine to handle a spike in traffic\, then automatically have that machine shut itself down when incoming requests settle back at manageable levels?\n\n  That’s one reason why\, today\, online apps from Google\, Facebook\, and others are written as “microservices.” Far from being worthy of the buzzword-driven hype\, this paradigm is actually a return to software’s original designs where the goals of a larger application are processed independently by a set of cooperating but independent smaller programs\, each one performing only one job very well. To make this work in today’s cloud environments\, each microservice must be “containerized\,” packaged into a single Operating System process that is run by a container management engine such as Docker\, CoreOS’s rkt (pronounced “rocket”)\, or LXD in preparation for being orchestrated across a fleet of hundreds or thousands of (often virtual) compute instances.\n\n  In this hands-on workshop\, you’ll learn how to make use of the thousands of ready-made containers available at container registries such as the Docker Hub\, create new containers from scratch\, containerize existing codebases\, manage running containers\, and more. We’ll explore how to troubleshoot container failures\, show how to network multiple containers together\, and touch on container orchestration tools like Docker’s Swarm mode\, HashiCorp Nomad\, Apache Mesos/Marathon\, and Kubernetes to see how our containers can be automatically distributed\, or “scheduled\,” and be tasked with their specialized workloads across a virtual private cloud based on whatever resources we have available to us.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how easy it is to avoid certain forms of Internet censorship\, phishing attacks\, or network outages in this primer to the Domain Name System or DNS. Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses\, the DNS is actually a massively distributed\, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers\, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers\, anti-spam DNS resource records\, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the digital world of cyperspace networks\, such as the Internet\, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic\, such as Web browsing\, email\, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic\, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as google.com in our Web browser?\n\n  The answer lies in DNS\, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book\,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983\, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system\, the DNS is actually a massive\, distributed\, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of resource records (RRs). For instance\, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like SPF\, DKIM\, DMARC\, and DANE\, and CAA resource records)\, perform service discovery (with SRV records)\, and more.\n\n  Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial\, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop\, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself\, watching queries and replies\, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers\, called resolvers\, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the zone in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic\, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as DNSCrypt v2\, DNS-over-TLS (DoT)\, and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\, which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

You’ll get your own Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy apps\, learn how to influence scheduling decisions\, and monitor the health of clustered workloads.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As anyone who has ever moved house knows\, the more effectively you can pack\, the easier your move will be. It’s a big task\, often requiring thousands of tiny decisions to make sure delicate items are wrapped appropriately\, all one’s stuff fits neatly into all the available boxes\, and so on. Once the boxes are all packed\, loading them onto a moving vehicle requires that you distribute their weight more or less evenly so that there are no unpleasant surprises during the move. This is more or less what container orchestration tools are for\, except instead of moving physical bins\, we have to ship software inside containers. Each container requires resources\, like CPU time and memory space\, which means we’ll need to play a sort of Tetris game to make sure all our containers fit in the most dense\, yet most balanced\, arrangement to keep our hardware costs as low as possible.\n\n  Kubernetes is the free and open source industry standard container orchestration platform that provides both system administrators and application developers with a set of tools for cooperatively building\, deploying\, and maintaining applications at all levels of scale. Its job is to help you get the most out of your hardware by “packing” all your containers (installed server software) into the fewest possible “bins” (physical or virtual machines)\, and then automatically monitoring\, restarting\, adding\, removing\, or shuffling those containers from one machine to another as demand for the services running on your cluster change. Your job is to tell Kubernetes what your ideal deployment situation is\, and what to prioritize when resources get scarce.\n\n  In this intermediate-level workshop\, we’ll build on our knowledge of Linux containers and fundamental system administration tasks to explore a Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn how to inspect workloads using the kubectl command line utility\, a graphical Web-based dashboard\, and the Kubernetes API itself. By exploring the Kubernetes control plane\, you’ll get insight into how Kubernetes makes scheduling decisions and\, along with using Labels and Selectors\, you’ll learn how to influence those scheduling decisions by tainting certain resources in specific ways. Finally\, you’ll see how Kubernetes provides a set of “cloud-native” services and APIs that developers can use to write apps that spawn more replicas of themselves when needed and perform other forms of automated or self-healing tasks\, making the system administrator’s job that much easier.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get your message out without revealing who you are by publishing anonymously on the “Darknet.” This workshop shows you how to create Tor Onion services for Web sites through free tools like OnionShare\, and even by setting up Tor servers that are built and configured from scratch manually. You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online\, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass\, fingerprint correlation\, and other similar attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth\, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes\, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations\, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing\, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or\, if you’re really skilled\, completely anonymously.\n\n  Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet\, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook\, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings\, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies\, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals\, and so too do politically vocal bloggers\, investigative journalists\, and citizens.\n\n  In this specialized workshop\, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road\, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times\, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services\, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers\, network relays\, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal\, a free\, secure\, private message app is simple enough to schedule drinks with\, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed\, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action\, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset\, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies\, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.\n\n  Signal is the name of a Free Software\, secure\, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or\, more commonly\, the Double-Ratchet Algorithm\, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e.\, end-to-end encryption\, message authentication\, plausible deniability or message repudiation\, perfect forward secrecy\, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling\, location- and file-sharing features\, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!\n\n  If you’ve never heard of Signal before\, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal\, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification\, disappearing messages\, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers\, inactivity lock-outs\, and Signal relay server IP address protection).

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:BitTorrent\, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol\, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers\, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology\, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard\, Inc. use it every day\, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own\, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet\,” you probably heard of BitTorrent or its more colloquial synonym\, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans\, financial penalties\, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns\, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard\, immoral\, and unsafe to use\, but the reality is far less one-sided.\n\n  BitTorrent refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network\, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior\, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover\, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products\, such as Blizzard\, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company)\, who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players.\n\n  Today\, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular\, cost-efficient\, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills\, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like ZeroNet are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before\, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g.\, PeerTube) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called WebTorrent to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.\n\n  In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find\, download\, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends\, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption\, connecting to trackers through public proxies and Virtual Private Networks\, and building private seedboxes.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

With today’s modern automation toolkits\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company\, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible\, Vagrant\, and Terraform\, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s IT environments\, application servers\, databases\, file shares\, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision\, configure\, and administer one at a time. To deploy\, maintain\, and secure large digital fleets\, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching\, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations\, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact\; today\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.\n\n  Generically called Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\, modern configuration management tools like Ansible\, Chef\, SaltStack\, and Puppet make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like Vagrant\, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams\, massively streamlining everything from software development\, to R&amp\;D\, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard\, vendor-neutral\, open formats such as Terraform means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all\, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts\, outages\, or even mere accidents can be audited\, diagnosed\, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC)\, add multiple machines to it\, automatically install server software on those machines\, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work\, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size\, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You don’t need to have your doctorate in theoretical mathematics to understand crypto enough to use it safely\, but you do need to use it safely to be secure! Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations\, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical\, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography\, stream and block ciphers\, digital signatures\, one-way hash functions\, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)\, and more.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every time you use a modern computer\, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root\, these functions\, called cryptographic primitives\, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices\, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works\, from password vaults to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to BitCoin and beyond.\n\n  Today\, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free\, even if they don’t realize it. Signal Private Messenger’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The Tor anonymity network? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography\, and digital signatures\, oh my)!\n\n  Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e.\, mathematical weapons\, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math\, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “Crypto Wars” in the 1990’s.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades\, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice\, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated\, practice developing your own simple ciphers\, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy)\, integrity-protection (authenticity)\, and more. By the end of this workshop\, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach\, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises\, like NFS\, SMB\, and WebDAV.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As early as 1964\, computer makers like IBM\, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course\, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office\,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably\, secured properly\, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.\n\n  These days\, however\, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized\, individuals\, community groups\, political organizers\, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, Microsoft Office 365\, and Dropbox Paper come in\, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud\,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age\, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free\, Libre\, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself\, for a small group of friends\, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder\,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like WebDAV to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents\, Excel spreadsheets\, and PDFs\, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like Nextcloud. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called Network-Attached Storage (NAS) devices like the (Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that are common in Web hosting environments\, and the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols that are common in homes and offices.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come exploring with us as we show you how to map out interconnections between computers\, trace packet routes across network gateways\, and find information about network operators. In this workshop all about the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments\, we use tools like nmap to send probes into cyberspace and tap into the wire with Wireshark to understand how they function.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace\, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace\, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!\n\n  These are the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way\, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices\, such as routers\, firewalls\, traffic inspectors\, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey\, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next\, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as nmap along with digital wiretapping tools like Wireshark we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.\n\n  Join us to explore strange new networks\, to seek out new devices and new organizations\, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:To take full advantage of the Web\, especially as a digital publishing medium\, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML\, the HyperText Markup Language\, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures\, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online\, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why\, then\, is it so rarely explained in terms of the language that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar\, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end\, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language\, and that includes HTML.\n\n  This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice\, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course\, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa\, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find\, use\, and most importantly understand what you’re saying.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
