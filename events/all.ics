DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to provide file sharing services by creating your own networked file server so that your family\, friends\, or colleagues have a private place to save\, share\, and work on documents or photos together. Maintaining the humble file server is among the most fundamental Information Technology (IT) department tasks in businesses or organizations big and small because most other activities revolve around document storage and retrieval. In this workshop\, you’ll be introduced to numerous free and open technologies such as Nextcloud that can replace more familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, along with many of the file sharing protocols integral to Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices used in today’s enterprises\, like NFS\, SMB\, and WebDAV.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As early as 1964\, computer makers like IBM\, Inc. were publicizing the idea that businesses could use computers to eliminate or drastically reduce the drudgery and tedium of paperwork by converting paper documents into electronic files. Of course\, even today not all businesses have what IBM promised would be a “paperless office\,” but many of them have a rapidly growing number of important digital documents that need to be stored reliably\, secured properly\, and shared privately. This is what makes the humble file server a centerpiece of Information Technology (IT) department responsibilities.\n\n  These days\, however\, it’s not just businesses who must manage loads of electronic documents. As society becomes increasingly digitized\, individuals\, community groups\, political organizers\, and even hobbyists are much more reliant on electronic files today than we have ever been before. This is where familiar Web-based online file storage services like Google Docs\, Microsoft Office 365\, and Dropbox Paper come in\, making it easy for people to save their work in “the cloud\,” as long as they’re comfortable letting the company providing the storage service have a peek at their work. But like most things in the Internet age\, the file storage and retrieval services that these companies offer are built on the back of Free\, Libre\, and Open Source Software programs and protocols available to everyone from individuals to large enterprises without paying a dime for them in either monetary cost or privacy exposure.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what it takes to build your own online file storage service for yourself\, for a small group of friends\, or for a much larger organization. Starting with a simple “shared folder\,” you’ll get introduced to network protocols like WebDAV to see how they enable Web-based distributed authoring and versioning of files including Word documents\, Excel spreadsheets\, and PDFs\, and how these protocols fit into enterprise-ready file storage systems like Nextcloud. We’ll also discuss filesystem-level networked filing protocols that define a whole category of computer equipment called Network-Attached Storage (NAS) devices like the (Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) that are common in Web hosting environments\, and the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols that are common in homes and offices.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety will cut through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle\, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds\, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts\,” how do you know which tool to use\, when\, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really should use\, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover\, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself\, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?\n\n  This beginner’s workshop taught by the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers offers a simple framework anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective\, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City\, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money\, people\, etcetera) does my attacker have?”\n\n  Although there are many good and free tools available\, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like Signal)\, a password manager (like KeePass or Bitwarden\, and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers\, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short\, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place\, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you should take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in\, how to find out if you have been “pwned\,” what the risks are\, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force\, credential stuffing\, and other forms of account takeover attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you been “pwned”? For years\, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at HaveIBeenPwned.com that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is\, if your personal information such as your password\, has been leaked\, accessed\, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on\, check for yourself!\n\n  If you’ve been “pwned\,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be\, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course\, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.\n\n\n\n  Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them\, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side\, learn professional techniques for recovering passwords from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation\, such as using optimized wordlists\, word-mangling rulesets\, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to manage your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) datacenter environment and make the most of cloud infrastructure providers (“IaaS platforms”) by automatically deploying underlying infrastructure\, including network topology\, firewall rulesets\, DNS records\, and other resources. This intermediate-level workshop introduces you to Terraform\, a free\, agentless\, masterless\, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) digital operations provisioning tool used by many of the largest organizations in the world but simple enough to use on a team of one.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the beginning\, there was the mainframe: a single\, gigantic machine that held all the data and did all the work by itself\, like a digital planet suspended in the vast emptiness of cyberspace. Then came networks\, the personal computer\, the Internet\, Web 2.0\, cloud computing\, microservices\, and containers—a whole cybergalaxy to explore. While the world today looks very different than it did in the days of the mainframe\, every project still needs to start at the beginning: get at least one computer to hold all project data and do all project work. So how do modern projects go from a single computer to a whole galaxy so quickly?\n\n  For many (including Tech Learning Collective!)\, the answer is Terraform\, a free\, open source\, and extensible tool that can provision and manage any number of infrastructural resources from source code repositories to cloud compute instances to DNS records and much\, much more. Using Terraform\, engineers describe the digital environment they’d like to have by writing it down in a simple\, declarative configuration language called HCL. Then\, when instructed\, Terraform does the work of metaphorically\, well\, terraforming cyberspace to match the engineer’s description.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of how to set up Terraform for your organization. We’ll also go over best practices for ensuring testing\, staging\, and production infrastructures stay isolated from one another\, how to compose reusable modules\, and how to share your Terraform configurations as well as project state with collaborators. At the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand how to bring the cloud down to earth.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:To take full advantage of the Web\, especially as a digital publishing medium\, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML\, the HyperText Markup Language\, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures\, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online\, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why\, then\, is it so rarely explained in terms of the language that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar\, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end\, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language\, and that includes HTML.\n\n  This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice\, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course\, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa\, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find\, use\, and most importantly understand what you’re saying.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The most common way hackers steal passwords\, install malware on a victim’s computer\, or get employees to grant them unauthorized access to critical business systems is through so-called phishing attacks. A phishing attack is surprisingly low-tech\, which is part of what makes it so devastatingly effective. Learning to spot these attacks is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself online\, since a hacker’s tricks\, called “lures\,” can appear anywhere from an email\, to a Facebook message\, to a real Web site that looks exactly like one you recognize! In this workshop\, you’ll learn how frighteningly easy it is to build these scam sites\, and all about the tricks they use to fool you into falling for them.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Whether it’s corporate espionage\, ransomware\, or online fraud\, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits\, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because\, much like baiting a lure\, they won’t work unless you bite. However\, many people do get caught up by them.\n\n  In 2019\, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam\, costing businesses over $12 billion in losses. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today\, with one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month. Thankfully\, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.\n\n  For example\, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings\, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and offered to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios\, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company\, home\, or organization’s network.\n\n  In this workshop\, derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course\, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen\, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site\, email\, or other online scam.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Ever work on a project with other people? Of course you do. If you’ve been saving files with names like “Project-outline-1” and then saving another version of that file as “Project-outline-2” then you already understand the importance of a Version Control System (VCS). In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll see the popular Git version control system in action and learn how to improve your collaborative workflow whether you’re a software engineer\, novelist\, or art designer.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As most of us know first-hand\, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here\, trimming a little bit there\, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file\, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice\, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?\n\n  This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track\, compare\, and merge different versions of the same project\, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times\, across any number of files. Moreover\, by naming different snapshots\, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others\; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a branch) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of Git\, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like GitHub are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers\, Git is also useful for novelists\, researchers\, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language\,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably\, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g.\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API)\, develop PC games (using GDevelop)\, and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser\, office job\, or your own project.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Over the course of ten days in 1995\, the Web changed forever when Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape\, Inc. and developed a programming language that could be embedded in Web pages. Briefly named LiveScript\, the language became known as JavaScript three months later\, and was officially standardized as ECMAScript in 1997 after taking the Internet by storm only two years later. Today\, JavaScript is arguably the single most popular and prolific high-level language available to many people for many projects.\n\n  Although most people know of JavaScript as the programming language of the Web\, where its capabilities have increased dramatically over the years\, many other environments outside of the Web browser or traditional Web application now embed or rely on JavaScript engines to work. Entire back-end applications can be created with “server-side JavaScript” (Node.js\, RingoJS)\; Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices like sensors and larger microcontrollers offer JavaScript scriptable interfaces (Espruino\, low.js)\; mundane office jobs and “paperwork” can be accomplished in JavaScript (OpenOffice/LibreOffice Script Provider\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office JavaScript API)\; JavaScript can be used to write smart contracts for blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies (Hyperledger Fabric)\; desktop and PC game programming can be done entirely in JavaScript (GDevelop\, Babylon.js)\; some other programming languages are implemented in JavaScript (Scratch)\; and JavaScript can even be used for macOS system automation tasks using the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) JavaScript for Automation extension. Almost no other programming language is as easy to learn while offering the breadth of options that JavaScript does\, which is one clear reason for the language’s popularity among developers and desirability among employers.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment. By focusing on the language’s built-in constructs\, you’ll be able to avoid many common pitfalls and understand what makes JavaScript tick. We’ll cover some programming basics common to all languages\, but we’ll also show how JavaScript’s unusual rules (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) make it possible to write especially elegant—or especially dangerous—code\, as well as showing you why developing even minimal proficiency with JavaScript will drastically increase your “digital dexterity” as you browse the Web.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Water in a Garden: The Style and Substance of Cascading Style Sheets

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The way some hypermedia object\, like a Web page\, presents itself is encoded using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features\, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop\, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials\, like how to understand the concept of document flow\, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size\, position\, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling\, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries\, modern layout modules\, and other CSS capabilities.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  All physical mediums like print\, music\, or film can be beautiful\, but they will always be constrained by the fact of their analog nature. Digital media—and specifically hypermedia—is different. It can change both its form and its function\, simultaneously presenting itself as any one or a combination of multimedia formats without changing its underlying structure. The humble Web page is a good example: it can stretch to fit your screen when viewed in a Web browser\, lay itself out on a page to prepare for being printed\, and even embed voice cues so it can be more easily listened to when read aloud. All of this is done using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\, one of the most powerful\, and most often misused\, features of the modern Web.\n\n  Although the CSS language itself is decades old now\, its origins are even older. Rooted in the idea that form and function can simultaneously coexist in a multitude of different arrangements\, CSS makes it possible for a single well-formed digital object to appear in the “best” way to any given viewer (or reader\, or listener). This is a radical departure from physical media\, like paper\, and it requires an equally radical departure from some traditional graphic design paradigms that demands we spend an equal amount of time exploring philosophical issues like “the eye of the beholder” as it demands that we familiarize ourselves with technical implementation details such as the mathematical equations determining when\, where\, and how to draw specific shapes or colors.\n\n  This workshop builds on the concepts of hypertext introduced in Tech Learning Collective’s “The Web as a Language” workshop by speaking of fundamental CSS concepts often omitted from other tutorials\, such as “User Agents\,” document flow\, and rendering contexts. You’ll learn how both the design and the function of your digital creations can benefit from approaching hypermedia more fluidly\, so you can work with the CSS rendering engine in most modern graphical programming environments rather than fighting against it. Like water\, your Web pages\, apps\, and other hypertextual creations will be able to flow seamlessly into vessels of any shape\, Operating System\, or Web Browser vendor.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
