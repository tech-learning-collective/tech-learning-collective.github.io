DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in\, how to find out if you have been “pwned\,” what the risks are\, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force\, credential stuffing\, and other forms of account takeover attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you been “pwned”? For years\, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at HaveIBeenPwned.com that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is\, if your personal information such as your password\, has been leaked\, accessed\, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on\, check for yourself!\n\n  If you’ve been “pwned\,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be\, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course\, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.\n\n\n\n  Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them\, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side\, learn professional techniques for recovering passwords from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation\, such as using optimized wordlists\, word-mangling rulesets\, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:To take full advantage of the Web\, especially as a digital publishing medium\, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML\, the HyperText Markup Language\, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures\, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online\, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why\, then\, is it so rarely explained in terms of the language that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar\, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end\, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language\, and that includes HTML.\n\n  This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice\, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course\, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa\, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find\, use\, and most importantly understand what you’re saying.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The way some hypermedia object\, like a Web page\, presents itself is encoded using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). While CSS is one of the modern Web’s most powerful features\, it’s also one of its most misunderstood and misused inventions. In this workshop\, you’ll learn important CSS fundamentals that are often missing from most tutorials\, like how to understand the concept of document flow\, as well as gain insight into the equations and rendering algorithms that determine things like a CSS box’s size\, position\, and more that are at work behind the scenes in every stylesheet. We’ll also touch on how CSS can be used in contexts beyond HTML including print and mobile app styling\, and how to use some more advanced features like media and feature queries\, modern layout modules\, and other CSS capabilities.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  All physical mediums like print\, music\, or film can be beautiful\, but they will always be constrained by the fact of their analog nature. Digital media—and specifically hypermedia—is different. It can change both its form and its function\, simultaneously presenting itself as any one or a combination of multimedia formats without changing its underlying structure. The humble Web page is a good example: it can stretch to fit your screen when viewed in a Web browser\, lay itself out on a page to prepare for being printed\, and even embed voice cues so it can be more easily listened to when read aloud. All of this is done using a language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\, one of the most powerful\, and most often misused\, features of the modern Web.\n\n  Although the CSS language itself is decades old now\, its origins are even older. Rooted in the idea that form and function can simultaneously coexist in a multitude of different arrangements\, CSS makes it possible for a single well-formed digital object to appear in the “best” way to any given viewer (or reader\, or listener). This is a radical departure from physical media\, like paper\, and it requires an equally radical departure from some traditional graphic design paradigms that demands we spend an equal amount of time exploring philosophical issues like “the eye of the beholder” as it demands that we familiarize ourselves with technical implementation details such as the mathematical equations determining when\, where\, and how to draw specific shapes or colors.\n\n  This workshop builds on the concepts of hypertext introduced in Tech Learning Collective’s “The Web as a Language” workshop by speaking of fundamental CSS concepts often omitted from other tutorials\, such as “User Agents\,” document flow\, and rendering contexts. You’ll learn how both the design and the function of your digital creations can benefit from approaching hypermedia more fluidly\, so you can work with the CSS rendering engine in most modern graphical programming environments rather than fighting against it. Like water\, your Web pages\, apps\, and other hypertextual creations will be able to flow seamlessly into vessels of any shape\, Operating System\, or Web Browser vendor.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:JavaScript is known for being “the Web programming language\,” and while its capabilities in a Web browser have grown considerably\, today JavaScript can also be used to automate mundane office jobs (e.g.\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office’s JavaScript API)\, develop PC games (using GDevelop)\, and much more. Learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment in this workshop covering some common programming concepts as well as the quirks of the JavaScript language itself (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) so you can increase your digital dexterity whether in a Web browser\, office job\, or your own project.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Over the course of ten days in 1995\, the Web changed forever when Brendan Eich was hired by Netscape\, Inc. and developed a programming language that could be embedded in Web pages. Briefly named LiveScript\, the language became known as JavaScript three months later\, and was officially standardized as ECMAScript in 1997 after taking the Internet by storm only two years later. Today\, JavaScript is arguably the single most popular and prolific high-level language available to many people for many projects.\n\n  Although most people know of JavaScript as the programming language of the Web\, where its capabilities have increased dramatically over the years\, many other environments outside of the Web browser or traditional Web application now embed or rely on JavaScript engines to work. Entire back-end applications can be created with “server-side JavaScript” (Node.js\, RingoJS)\; Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices like sensors and larger microcontrollers offer JavaScript scriptable interfaces (Espruino\, low.js)\; mundane office jobs and “paperwork” can be accomplished in JavaScript (OpenOffice/LibreOffice Script Provider\, Google Apps Script\, Microsoft Office JavaScript API)\; JavaScript can be used to write smart contracts for blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies (Hyperledger Fabric)\; desktop and PC game programming can be done entirely in JavaScript (GDevelop\, Babylon.js)\; some other programming languages are implemented in JavaScript (Scratch)\; and JavaScript can even be used for macOS system automation tasks using the Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) JavaScript for Automation extension. Almost no other programming language is as easy to learn while offering the breadth of options that JavaScript does\, which is one clear reason for the language’s popularity among developers and desirability among employers.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn what you need to know to get started with JavaScript in any environment. By focusing on the language’s built-in constructs\, you’ll be able to avoid many common pitfalls and understand what makes JavaScript tick. We’ll cover some programming basics common to all languages\, but we’ll also show how JavaScript’s unusual rules (functional scope\, prototype-based object inheritance\, etc.) make it possible to write especially elegant—or especially dangerous—code\, as well as showing you why developing even minimal proficiency with JavaScript will drastically increase your “digital dexterity” as you browse the Web.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:The most common way hackers steal passwords\, install malware on a victim’s computer\, or get employees to grant them unauthorized access to critical business systems is through so-called phishing attacks. A phishing attack is surprisingly low-tech\, which is part of what makes it so devastatingly effective. Learning to spot these attacks is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself online\, since a hacker’s tricks\, called “lures\,” can appear anywhere from an email\, to a Facebook message\, to a real Web site that looks exactly like one you recognize! In this workshop\, you’ll learn how frighteningly easy it is to build these scam sites\, and all about the tricks they use to fool you into falling for them.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Whether it’s corporate espionage\, ransomware\, or online fraud\, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits\, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because\, much like baiting a lure\, they won’t work unless you bite. However\, many people do get caught up by them.\n\n  In 2019\, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam\, costing businesses over $12 billion in losses. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today\, with one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month. Thankfully\, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.\n\n  For example\, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings\, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and offered to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios\, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company\, home\, or organization’s network.\n\n  In this workshop\, derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course\, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen\, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site\, email\, or other online scam.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop is a practical introduction to creating\, using\, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before\, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity\, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software\, and much more!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so\, no matter what you’re doing on your computer\, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example\, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes\, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing\, or “containerizing\,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.\n\n  Today\, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers\, servers\, and global data networks work\, and cross-platform\, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by VeraCrypt)\, network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g.\, using VLANs) or even the whole Internet (using INetSim)\, processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g.\, in QEMU)\, and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by Proxmox). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features\, such as in the Qubes Operating System\, macOS’s App Sandbox\, and Firefox Containers.\n\n  Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit\, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the VirtualBox type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly\, browse the Web more safely\, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers\, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure\, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems\, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist\, like inception\, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to beat back configuration drift on your servers by leveraging automation tools like Ansible in this deep dive workshop demonstrating modern DevOps practices for deploying\, maintaining\, and auditing compute clusters. Whether for a Web application\, big data processing\, or other project\, you need to turn old-school runbooks into computerized playbooks that can execute Standard Operating Procedures quickly and reliably so you can deploy complex systems simply and predictably. Come learn about key concepts like idempotence and change control\, and learn how giant corporations implement security principles like RBAC\, all using free and open source software.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Today\, all but the most trivial of computer systems rely on an interdependent set of servers working in concert. You don’t just have one server\, you have a group of them. Commonly called a cluster\, these servers need to be managed as a group\, ensuring that their software configurations\, security patches\, and installed packages are deployed\, maintained\, and eventually updated or retired in a predictable way.\n\n  In this deep dive workshop\, we’ll set up our own small cluster and use Ansible\, which is an agentless\, cross-platform\, enterprise-grade\, free software Configuration Management (CM) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework used by giant corporations like IBM and Cisco\, to turn old-school operator runbooks into computerized playbooks that can be executed quickly and easily even by novice operators. Through several hands-on exercises\, you’ll learn about the entire CM lifecycle from planning through auditing so that you understand critical CM concepts like idempotence\, change control\, and more\, which are common to all CM systems including Chef\, Puppet\, and Salt.\n\n  Along the way\, you’ll be exposed to key concepts such as containerization through Ansible’s support for automating container builds\, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Ansible’s AWX Project\, and more. By adopting configuration management workflows with tools like Ansible\, you can reduce operator errors\, and beat back configuration drift on any long-lived infrastructure components.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers\, hidden away behind locked doors\, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly\, others scary\, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages\, the command line\, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  To be useful\, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically\, the way you can control a computer is called a user interface because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is\, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs\, which are the buttons\, windows\, and other controls that you can point-and-click on\, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your pointer or mouse cursor) and\, worse\, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI\, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse\, you cannot manipulate it.\n\n  This is why almost all hackers\, programmers\, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many\, if not most\, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line\, or “terminal\,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover\, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time\, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer\, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders\, processing text\, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language\, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of securing digital infrastructure by taking a deep-dive into the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\, a fundamental component of safe administrative access to remote servers. Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations\, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up\, access\, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself\, friends\, or comrades.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every app you use—from messengers like Signal or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like WordPress and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and online maps—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone)\, or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”)\, no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services\, somewhere. So\, do you know where your servers are? If not\, you can’t know how safe your data is!\n\n  When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there\, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar\, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned\, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation\, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.\n\n  This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration\, Networking\, and Security courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup\, monitoring\, and maintenance. By taking a deep dive into the SSH protocol\, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way\, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers\, Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks\, and much more. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself\, your friends\, and your comrades\, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop shows you how to keep your emails private regardless of what email provider you use. By learning how to use the freely and widely available Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cryptosystem in email\, you will see how easy it is to not only encrypt messages so that they remain confidential\, but also how to make sure the emails you get were really sent by the people they claim to be from. Once you’re able to verify the sender of email you receive\, you’re far less likely to get caught up in an email phishing scam ever again.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As one of the oldest digital communication methods\, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does\, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective\, it’s more like “e-postcards” because\, just like sending a postcard through the postal service\, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.\n\n  In the physical world\, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way\, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world\, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services\, like ProtonMail\, claim to do this for you\, but fail to do so in many common scenarios. Meanwhile\, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google\, but this isn’t always true either.\n\n  This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using freely available OpenPGP-compatible software\, which has been available since 1991\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can help you evade Internet censorship\, protect your network traffic\, and offer easier access to remote services on firewalled internal networks. You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN\, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution\, so that you can connect securely to your home\, office\, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are\, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How often have you wished you could be in two places at once? That’s exactly what Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology was designed to allow computers to do. First popularized in 1996 by Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)\, using VPN technology made it possible for two disconnected networks to be knit back together into one as long as each of them were connected to a third middle network\, even if that middle network was hostile or untrusted. Today\, that middle network is usually the Internet\, which can certainly be hostile and untrusted! With a VPN\, it’s possible to be “here” (on your actual network) and “there” (on the other side of the VPN connection) at the same time\; by signing into a VPN service\, you create a “VPN tunnel” that acts like a wormhole in space-time in that whatever you send into the tunnel emerges on the other side as though the two sides of the tunnel are next to each other.\n\n  Throughout the late 1990’s and 2000’s\, VPN technology saw a surge in use among businesses looking for ways to enable remote workers. Using VPNs made it simpler for a colleague to travel because they could still be “directly connected” to their office network. By 2001\, the OpenVPN project made this amazing technology free and open source for GNU/Linux systems\, with cross-platform implementations for Mac OS X and Windows arriving shortly thereafter. Today\, OpenVPN servers form the bedrock of many modern free and commercial VPN solutions\, and are still the most widely deployed VPN solution for most use cases.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get to see what happens when network packets are sent into VPN tunnels and how they appear on the other side in order to learn exactly how VPNs encapsulate—and secure—your computer’s communication with Web sites\, office servers\, or other services. You’ll see what it takes to set up your own OpenVPN server (not much!)\, as well as how to troubleshoot connection issues. You’ll also get introduced to several newer but less mature VPN protocols such as Wireguard\, and learn about Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions such as IPsec and its related tunneling (L2TP) and security (ESP\, IKE\, etcetera) protocols.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before\, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society\, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop\, but with global systems of law\, finance\, and even art\, literature\, and philosophy governing today’s world.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous\, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.\n\n  Modern computers are power tools\, and behind each one of them is a human operator\, or “system administrator\,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone\, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date\, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos\, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files\, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called daemons\, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors\, they make up the world of Operating System services\, signals\, sockets\, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer\, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS\, Windows\, BSD\, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like iptables\, nft\, and pfctl)\, you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks\, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences\, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools including dedicated firewall distributions (like pfSense and IPFire) as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers\, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works\, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort and Suricata.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s ubiquitous computing environment\, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its network connection. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware\, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration\, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus\, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router\, just about every computer has a firewall these days\, including your personal laptop.\n\n  Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology\, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time\, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks\, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).\n\n  But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called Netfilter and controlled with the iptables or nft commands) is the backbone of many commercial enterprise firewall distributions\, and it’s available free of charge. Plus\, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as Docker’s networking and Kubernetes’s kube-proxy\, among others.\n\n  So\, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows\, macOS\, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers\, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices\, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\, and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).
