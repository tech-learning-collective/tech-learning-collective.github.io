DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You have read about people who can talk to machines. Maybe you imagined secret chambers\, hidden away behind locked doors\, with dark rooms basking in blue from electric fires. Some of these people seemed friendly\, others scary\, but all of them were powerful. How did they learn to communicate with their computers? This is your chance to learn the foundations of all computer languages\, the command line\, and actually begin to talk to a machine yourself.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  To be useful\, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically\, the way you can control a computer is called a user interface because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is\, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs\, which are the buttons\, windows\, and other controls that you can point-and-click on\, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your pointer or mouse cursor) and\, worse\, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI\, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse\, you cannot manipulate it.\n\n  This is why almost all hackers\, programmers\, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many\, if not most\, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line\, or “terminal\,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover\, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time\, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer\, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders\, processing text\, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language\, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:BitTorrent\, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol\, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers\, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology\, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard\, Inc. use it every day\, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own\, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet\,” you probably heard of BitTorrent or its more colloquial synonym\, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans\, financial penalties\, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns\, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard\, immoral\, and unsafe to use\, but the reality is far less one-sided.\n\n  BitTorrent refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network\, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior\, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover\, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products\, such as Blizzard\, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company)\, who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players.\n\n  Today\, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular\, cost-efficient\, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills\, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like ZeroNet are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before\, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g.\, PeerTube) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called WebTorrent to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.\n\n  In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find\, download\, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends\, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption\, connecting to trackers through public proxies and Virtual Private Networks\, and building private seedboxes.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:You don’t need to have your doctorate in theoretical mathematics to understand crypto enough to use it safely\, but you do need to use it safely to be secure! Come learn the magic behind the math in this cryptography primer for those of us who are not “number people.” Using simplified examples and hands-on demonstrations\, this workshop (finally!) offers a practical\, accessible introduction to the foundations of modern cryptographic security protocols such as RSA public-key cryptography\, stream and block ciphers\, digital signatures\, one-way hash functions\, Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)\, and more.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every time you use a modern computer\, you invoke numerous simple mathematical functions that make it possible to do things like logging in to Web sites safely or “locking” (encrypting) your secret documents behind passwords. At their root\, these functions\, called cryptographic primitives\, are not that much more complicated than simple addition or division. But when used in concert with the massive storage capacities and processing speeds of our modern electronic devices\, they serve as the bedrock atop which every provably secure system works\, from password vaults to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to BitCoin and beyond.\n\n  Today\, everyone has full access to bulletproof “military grade encryption” for free\, even if they don’t realize it. Signal Private Messenger’s “Safety Numbers?” Those are cryptographic hash functions! One-time passwords generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy? They use nonces! The Tor anonymity network? That’s a mixnet! The padlock icon in the address bar of your Web browser? Block ciphers (and public-key cryptography\, and digital signatures\, oh my)!\n\n  Knowledge of cryptography was deemed so dangerous during the Cold War that ever since the end of World War II the United States and its military allies attempted to regulate access to these crypto powers by classifying them as “munitions” (i.e.\, mathematical weapons\, literally) and criminalizing their sale or export. But as the Internet gained widespread commercial adoption and more people became familiar with the underlying math\, the government largely relented. It eventually lost what is now retroactively known as the “Crypto Wars” in the 1990’s.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the kind of math that governments tried to keep secret for decades\, even if you’re “not a math person.” You’ll see hash functions in practice\, learn why longer “keys” are stronger by understanding how RSA secrets are generated\, practice developing your own simple ciphers\, and start combining primitives to create security protocols that satisfy multiple requirements like confidentiality (privacy)\, integrity-protection (authenticity)\, and more. By the end of this workshop\, the dizzying vocabulary crytographers use will be well within your reach\, as will the ability to understand any new “encryption” product on the market.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop shows you how to keep your emails private regardless of what email provider you use. By learning how to use the freely and widely available Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cryptosystem in email\, you will see how easy it is to not only encrypt messages so that they remain confidential\, but also how to make sure the emails you get were really sent by the people they claim to be from. Once you’re able to verify the sender of email you receive\, you’re far less likely to get caught up in an email phishing scam ever again.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As one of the oldest digital communication methods\, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does\, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective\, it’s more like “e-postcards” because\, just like sending a postcard through the postal service\, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.\n\n  In the physical world\, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way\, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world\, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services\, like ProtonMail\, claim to do this for you\, but fail to do so in many common scenarios. Meanwhile\, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google\, but this isn’t always true either.\n\n  This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using freely available OpenPGP-compatible software\, which has been available since 1991\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before\, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society\, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop\, but with global systems of law\, finance\, and even art\, literature\, and philosophy governing today’s world.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous\, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.\n\n  Modern computers are power tools\, and behind each one of them is a human operator\, or “system administrator\,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone\, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date\, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos\, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files\, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called daemons\, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors\, they make up the world of Operating System services\, signals\, sockets\, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer\, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to collect\, generate\, and manipulate data of all kinds so that you can make decisions and meet the challenges you’re facing. You’ll see how simple\, text-based data files and command-line utilities have been and are still being used in all sorts of applications today\, what spreadsheets have to offer\, and how all these tools differ from Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) like MySQL/MariaDB\, PostgreSQL\, Oracle\, or Microsoft SQL Server. This workshop will also touch on Web scraping\, form building\, mail merges\, data cleaning\, and other techniques you need to know to make automating the boring parts of your day possible.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If knowledge is power\, what is knowledge? On a computer\, knowledge comes from data. By collecting data relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve\, you can scrutinize it in various different ways until you’re able to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset\; you turn data into information\, and from that information you gain knowledge\, which gives you power. But this is all much easier said than done\, especially if you are not already familiar with how to work with digital data.\n\n  This workshop introduces you to the concepts and techniques you need to know to collect\, generate\, and manipulate digital information regardless of the specific application or problem domain you’re working in. Ever since the dawn of computing\, data has been a central element in computer use. After all\, what good is a computer without data to compute? Early databases took the form of stacks of physical punch cards. Later on\, databases were created out of structured text files (and many of these still exist on your computer today\, whether you realize it or not). With the advent of “personal” computing in the 1980’s\, digital spreadsheets in applications like Lotus 1-2-3 brought enterprise automation solutions to the masses—or it would have\, if more people had the opportunity to learn how to use these powerful tools.\n\n  Today\, massive datasets with billions or trillions of records are often stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) and are accessed using specialized computer languages such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). These databases are thus the crown jewels of every company or organization conducting business online. Everything that matters to them gets stored in a database of some kind\, from email subscriber lists\, customer records\, call logs\, and purchase orders\, to social media postings\, blog comments\, personal photos\, and much more. Practice working with different kinds of data to learn the foundations relevant to all data exploration and transformation tasks in this introductory workshop that will help you ensure you can get the right stuff to construct successful solutions to any problem.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

With today’s modern automation toolkits\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company\, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible\, Vagrant\, and Terraform\, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s IT environments\, application servers\, databases\, file shares\, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision\, configure\, and administer one at a time. To deploy\, maintain\, and secure large digital fleets\, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching\, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations\, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact\; today\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.\n\n  Generically called Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\, modern configuration management tools like Ansible\, Chef\, SaltStack\, and Puppet make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like Vagrant\, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams\, massively streamlining everything from software development\, to R&amp\;D\, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard\, vendor-neutral\, open formats such as Terraform means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all\, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts\, outages\, or even mere accidents can be audited\, diagnosed\, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC)\, add multiple machines to it\, automatically install server software on those machines\, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work\, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size\, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to pilot Kubernetes and find out how it helps you get the most value out of your hardware. Kubernetes is the free\, enterprise-grade\, cloud-native solution for automated deployment\, scaling\, and management of containerized applications. This workshop offers an introduction to container orchestration concepts and practices by showing you how to work effectively with kubectl\, utilize Labels and Selectors\, explore various components of the Kubernetes control plane\, and more. You’ll get your own Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy apps\, learn how to influence scheduling decisions\, and monitor the health of clustered workloads.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As anyone who has ever moved house knows\, the more effectively you can pack\, the easier your move will be. It’s a big task\, often requiring thousands of tiny decisions to make sure delicate items are wrapped appropriately\, all one’s stuff fits neatly into all the available boxes\, and so on. Once the boxes are all packed\, loading them onto a moving vehicle requires that you distribute their weight more or less evenly so that there are no unpleasant surprises during the move. This is more or less what container orchestration tools are for\, except instead of moving physical bins\, we have to ship software inside containers. Each container requires resources\, like CPU time and memory space\, which means we’ll need to play a sort of Tetris game to make sure all our containers fit in the most dense\, yet most balanced\, arrangement to keep our hardware costs as low as possible.\n\n  Kubernetes is the free and open source industry standard container orchestration platform that provides both system administrators and application developers with a set of tools for cooperatively building\, deploying\, and maintaining applications at all levels of scale. Its job is to help you get the most out of your hardware by “packing” all your containers (installed server software) into the fewest possible “bins” (physical or virtual machines)\, and then automatically monitoring\, restarting\, adding\, removing\, or shuffling those containers from one machine to another as demand for the services running on your cluster change. Your job is to tell Kubernetes what your ideal deployment situation is\, and what to prioritize when resources get scarce.\n\n  In this intermediate-level workshop\, we’ll build on our knowledge of Linux containers and fundamental system administration tasks to explore a Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn how to inspect workloads using the kubectl command line utility\, a graphical Web-based dashboard\, and the Kubernetes API itself. By exploring the Kubernetes control plane\, you’ll get insight into how Kubernetes makes scheduling decisions and\, along with using Labels and Selectors\, you’ll learn how to influence those scheduling decisions by tainting certain resources in specific ways. Finally\, you’ll see how Kubernetes provides a set of “cloud-native” services and APIs that developers can use to write apps that spawn more replicas of themselves when needed and perform other forms of automated or self-healing tasks\, making the system administrator’s job that much easier.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to inscribe your thoughts\, dreams\, and desires into your computer and take your command line skills to the next level by learning how to write simple programs called shell scripts. In a way\, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively\, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs\, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  At their core\, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper\, they allow us to record our thoughts\, dreams\, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper\, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible\, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors\, industrial control systems\, biomedical devices\, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.\n\n  When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer\, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose\, text-only interface called a command line. Individually\, these instructions are called invocations. (Yes\, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to write whole spells\, rituals\, or (sacred) texts called shell scripts to inscribe your own thoughts\, dreams\, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.\n\n  By saving your scripts in files\, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and\, as such\, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work\, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety will cut through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle\, and offer an opportunity to ask your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions. By learning about foundational frameworks that cybersecurity professionals use to assess risk and safety such as the CIA triad and the three states of data\, you’ll build an understanding of information security from first principles to advanced techniques. By the end of this workshop\, you will be able to apply these building blocks to anything and everything you do online\, or in the streets.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds\, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts\,” how do you know which tool to use\, when\, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really should use\, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover\, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself\, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?\n\n  This beginner’s workshop taught by the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers offers a simple framework anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective\, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City\, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money\, people\, etcetera) does my attacker have?”\n\n  Although there are many good and free tools available\, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like Signal)\, a password manager (like KeePass or Bitwarden\, and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers\, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short\, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place\, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you should take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
