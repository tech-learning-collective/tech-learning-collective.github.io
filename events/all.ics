DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Queer hackers of the world\, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to Hex90’s latest queer hacker salon\, “Promiscuous Mode\,” hosted at Wonderville\, where you can buy tickets.\n\nlog tcp !192.168.0/24 any -&gt\; 192.168.0.2 (msg: "QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD\, UNITE" \; )\ntail /var/log/PROMISCUOUS.MODE\nAug 13 21:00 hex90 syslogd[135]: QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD\, UNITE\n\nHEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC\n\nIt is time for us to reach the sky! By sunlight and moonlight\, take flight! Let us imagine ourselves as stardust returning to our celestial origins\, intertwingled together. We will burn the stars with our radiance!\n\nHackers are elemental. Like water\, we are shapeless\, yet we are every shape. We transition between states as our environment changes\, changing the environment in the process. We can be as hard as ice\, or as soft as flame. Opaque\, or invisible\, or spanning everything in between\, we are the cloud. Ours is flesh that forms as quickly as it may float away. Impenetrable\, or permeable. Our bodies\, our choices\, from one fluid moment to the next.\n\nInformation packets traverse the ether. Netflows quickly vanish over the horizon. There are traces of fire on the wire connecting our vibrating crystalline bodies. Sniff the wire to prime your electronic memory with the sounds of conversations past and present. Enter promiscuous mode\, spread your wings\, and fly to the stars with us!\n\ninfo_\n\nAugust 13\, 2022 @ Wonderville\n1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY 11221\n9:00pm — 3:00am\n\n~ this venue is accessible\n~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms\n~ this venue has outdoor space\n\n# dressing up is encouraged but not required\n\nfeaturing_\n\n~ music performances by\n~~ Kandylion\n~~ DJ Softserve\n~ livecoded visuals by\n~~ Char Stiles (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ Voyde\n~~ gwenpri.me (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ schwaz (Livecode.NYC)\n~ algorave and electronic audio by\n~~ Alanza\n~~ alsoknownasrox (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ Azhad Syed (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ dan.dog\n~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade\n~ hacking demos &amp\; education by Tech Learning Collective\n~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL Space\n\nDANCE AT THE STAGE\, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!\n\nIn addition to music and visuals\, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop\, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue\, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer\," the game is not available on the public Internet.)\n\nAfter you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network\, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges\, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance\, applied cryptography\, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor\, and there's no high quite like it.\n\nWe continuously add levels to the game\, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover\, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue\, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords\, QR codes stashed in unexpected places\, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all\, and so on. At Hex90\, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.\n\nAll of the tools\, techniques\, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.\n\n#------------------#\n# START HACKING AT #\n#------------------#\nhttps://hex90.party\n\n#------------------#\n# BUY TICKETS HERE #\n#------------------#\nhttps://www.wonderville.nyc/events/hex90-promiscuous-mode\n\nSUPPORTER TIER:\n$30 - pay if you can\n\nADVANCE TICKETS:\n$15.00 - str8 cismen\n$10.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\nDAY-OF/AT THE DOOR:\n$20.00 - str8 cismen\n$15.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\n/**\n* Hex90 is an inclusive event.\n* Door staff is instructed to respect your self-identification.\n*/\n\nNOTICE:\nThis is an intentionally queer space.

Our ethics place us against “Adtech\,” “Fintech\,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth\, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism\, sterility\, and authoritarianism by being participatory\, flexible\, and adaptive.\n\nAbout XOXA\n\nXOXA (pronounced ex-oh-ex-ay) is a Brooklyn based queer collective of DJs\, artists and performers founded in 2017. Their mission is to provide a supportive platform for women and LGBTQ+ artists to perform while creating an intentional party space for women\, non-binary and trans individuals. You can follow @xoxanyc on Facebook and Instagram for more information on upcoming events and projects.\n\nAbout Kandylion\n\nKandylion has spent the better part of the last decade honing her DJ chops in the Brooklyn underground dance scene\, and is a current resident of queer nightlife collective XOXA. Her versatile and melodic mixes span genres and decades with an emphasis on feel-good house\, disco\, acid and breaks.\n\nAbout DJ Softserve\n\nStarting his DJ journey in South Korea\, DJ Softserve has since played in major festivals\, clubs and bars all over South Korea and the US. He is committed to creating the most fun dancefloor possible and blasts the frostiest beats for only the coolest homies.\n\nAbout LiveCode.NYC\n\nWe are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics\, games\, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group\, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding\, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this\, as a collective.\n\nAbout Char Stiles\n\nChar describes how photons work to sand that thinks\, that is to say she livecodes GLSL visuals on the computer\, that is to say she writes constantly compiling graphics algorithms on the GPU as a performance. This is in hopes it is entertainment.\n\nAbout Voyde\n\nIndira/Voyde uses Unreal Engine in creating surreal landscapes made of liquid bodies\, journalistic images\, and narrative snapshots hidden deep inside\, scrambled with voronoi.\n\nAbout gwenpri.me\n\ngwenpri.me is a creative technologist\, artist\, and livecoder. She makes live visuals from videos\, pictures\, emoji\, text\, and more\, then composites them using live code techniques. She enjoys finding arcane ways to put pixels on screens. Past sets have included touch designer patching\, Lua DSLs\, command line video editors\, and more.\n\nAbout Alanza\n\nAlanza is a polymath based in New York. Her music ranges from hardware improvisation to in-the-box pop production. She’s interested in synthesis\, odd rhythms\, things that make you think while dancing.\n\nAbout alsoknownasrox\n\nRoxanne Harris (alsoknownasrox) makes art by programming on-the-fly\, seeking to push the limitations of computation for creative expression\, both in new application and new foundational research. She spends her time finding new ways to engage with the world\, destructing and reconstructing existing structures as she goes.\n\nAbout dan.dog\n\nDan Gorelick is an SF and Brooklyn-based musician\, creative technologist\, and livecoder. He mixes acoustic instruments and voice with synthesizers (and code) to create expressive electronic music.\n\nAbout Death By Audio\n\nThe Death By Audio Arcade is a series of lovingly crafted local multiplayer arcade cabinets produced by local indie game developers. We are also a progressive\, open community of like-minded artists\, artisans\, and enthusiasts. We host events at least once a month\, in NYC and at events across the country\, from SXSW to the Smithsonian.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).
