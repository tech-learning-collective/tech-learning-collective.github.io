DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Queer hackers of the world\, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to Hex90’s latest queer hacker salon\, “Transposition\,” hosted at Wonderville\, where you can buy tickets.\n\n\n    Watch the Hex90: Transposition trailer.\n\n\n&lt\;p style=”text-align: center\;&gt\;Music: Black Hole Sun by Anatomy. Hex90 is brought to you by Tech Learning Collective and friends.&lt\;/p&gt\;\n\nDHRRE UNPXREF BS GUR JBEYQ\, HAVGR!\n\nHEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC\n\nChange has come again. It arrives streaming on the airwaves\, in the storms\, over the wires. Some fear it\, others welcome it\, but few deny it. Change transports us from where we were to where we must next be. It is not inevitable\, for we are the change. They will fight for stagnation\, but we will not be stopped.\n\nTransitions make us powerful. Transformation showed us difference\, gave us perspective\, and taught us adaptability. We have learned to reconfigure the world through command injection\, and to reconfigure ourselves through hormonal injections. To hackers\, these are the same: when we reconfigure ourselves\, we reconfigure the world. When we reconfigure the world\, we reconfigure ourselves.\n\nTranspose this and that. Redefine the problem. Substitute the premise. Shift bits left. Cycle one round at a time. Repeat for block after block. Again. Faster. FASTER. Continue until nothing is the same\, and beautiful differences are all that remain of the source.\n\nThis night\, we celebrate transposition\, the oldest witchcraft.\n\nGUVF AVTUG\, JR PRYROENGR GENAFCBFVGVBA\, GUR BYQRFG JVGPUPENSG.\n\ninfo_\n\nDecember 3\, 2022 @ Wonderville\n1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY 11221\n8:00pm — 4:00am\n\n~ this venue is accessible\n~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms\n~ this venue has outdoor space\n\n# dressing up is encouraged but not required\n\nfeaturing_\n\n~ music performances by\n~~ Sailor Malice\n~~ ÆON\n~~ trans kafka\n~~ heaven ender\n~ livecoded visuals by\n~~ gwenpri.me\n~~ Janie Jaffe\n~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade\n~ hacking demos &amp\; education by Tech Learning Collective\n~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL Space\n\nDANCE AT THE STAGE\, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!\n\nIn addition to music and visuals\, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop\, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue\, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer\," the game is not available on the public Internet.)\n\nAfter you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network\, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges\, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance\, applied cryptography\, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor\, and there's no high quite like it.\n\nWe continuously add levels to the game\, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover\, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue\, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords\, QR codes stashed in unexpected places\, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all\, and so on. At Hex90\, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.\n\nAll of the tools\, techniques\, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.\n\n#------------------#\n# START HACKING AT #\n#------------------#\nhttps://hex90.party\n\n#------------------#\n# BUY TICKETS HERE #\n#------------------#\nhttps://www.wonderville.nyc/events/hex90-transposition\n\nSUPPORTER TIER:\n$30 - pay if you can\n\nADVANCE TICKETS:\n$15.00 - str8 cismen\n$10.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\nDAY-OF/AT THE DOOR:\n$20.00 - str8 cismen\n$15.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\n/**\n* Hex90 is an inclusive event.\n* Door staff is instructed to respect your self-identification.\n*/\n\nNOTICE:\nThis is an intentionally queer space.

Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Shift-CTRL Space\n\nWe are anti-(techno)capitalists\, solarpunks\, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech\,” “Fintech\,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth\, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism\, sterility\, and authoritarianism by being participatory\, flexible\, and adaptive.\n\nAbout ÆON\n\nÆON is a Brooklyn based DJ and producer. Her sound melds jagged psychedelic techno with soaring trance melodies for a raw and hard hitting energy that packs dance floors city wide. As cofounder of the Palacio party series she sources sounds from the Bushwick underground to bring forward\, with a distinct focus on voices from her own trans community.\n\nAbout heaven ender\n\nheaven ender is an immortal entity inhabiting the mortal plane of existence seeking to make the world a more beautiful place. Rising from the dark corners of the rave scene they will be presenting one of their unrelenting\, genre blurring sets and condemning you to dance for eternity.\n\nAbout trans kafka\n\nInspired by a lifelong interest in games\, trans kafka’s psychedelic and emotional high-energy sound explores the crossover between techno\, trance\, electro\, and vgm.\n\nAbout LiveCode.NYC\n\nWe are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics\, games\, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group\, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding\, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this\, as a collective.\n\nAbout gwenpri.me\n\ngwenpri.me is a creative technologist\, artist\, and livecoder. She makes live visuals from videos\, pictures\, emoji\, text\, and more\, then composites them using live code techniques. She enjoys finding arcane ways to put pixels on screens. Past sets have included touch designer patching\, Lua DSLs\, command line video editors\, and more.\n\nAbout Death By Audio\n\nThe Death By Audio Arcade is a series of lovingly crafted local multiplayer arcade cabinets produced by local indie game developers. We are also a progressive\, open community of like-minded artists\, artisans\, and enthusiasts. We host events at least once a month\, in NYC and at events across the country\, from SXSW to the Smithsonian.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).
