DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Start Summer off with a bang. We‚Äôre not talking about fireworks (although those are nice\, too). We‚Äôre talking about our good friend and collaborator\, Vi‚Äôs incredible three-in-one party night. Vi has been an incredible source of knowledge\, inspiration\, and persistence throughout all of Tech Learning Collective history. In partnership with others\, she co-founded our school and continues to be involved in community efforts to increase the digital literacy and safety of queer and trans folks to this day.\n\nIn many past posts on our blog\, as well as across the Web in recorded podcasts and on Internet radio\, you can listen to her impassioned takes on Internet history and the future of technology\, its impact on marginalized groups\, and her critiques of Silicon Valley‚Äôs approaches to ‚Äúmaking the world a better place‚Äù all while advocating for a more technologically savvy and self-empowered relationship with digital technology. Although an enigma to many\, she is nothing if not iconoclastic\, embodying the very best of the trans hacker stereotype.\n\nToday\, Vi plays double-duty as a full time employee back in Silicon Valley after a long personal struggle\, as well as remaining a core organizer for the Hex90 queer hacker parties in New York City\, an advisor to a number of anarchist tech collectives\, and of course a central figure in Tech Learning Collective operations. Vi is turning 1 year old soon\, as her HRT anniversary is around the corner and\, true to form\, she‚Äôs decided to turn her party into something more communal.\n\nDirect from Vi ‚Äúlike the text editor‚Äù herself:\n\n\n  Hi\, friends! Pride Month has come and gone but there‚Äôs one more (massive) celebration to be had!\n\n  Join me\, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess\, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event: the company I work for tapped me to organize a ‚ÄúHow was your pride?‚Äù post-pride month Happy Hour\, and I‚Äôm combining it with my ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù party and the next Killer Queen Open Hive Night at Wonderville.\n\n  The ‚ÄúHow was your Pride?‚Äù Happy Hour is for my co-workers in NYC\, and I‚Äôm inviting them all to combine forces with the NYC Killer Queen scene for their weekly Open Hive Night. That day is also my trans birthday celebration\, so all three events are happening in the same place at the same time\, all in one amazing evening!\n\n  Join me and other colleagues (LGBTQ+ and allies) on Tuesday\, July 5th\, 5PM through 9PM at Wonderville in the center of the queer universe in Brooklyn. That Tuesday\, come learn how to play the popular 10-player strategy arcade game ‚ÄúKiller Queen‚Äù from some of NYC‚Äôs best players and NYC‚Äôs newest Queen Bee\, yours truly! Come also to share Pride Month stories\, meet one another in physical space\, and meet more queer NYC locals. And of course\, also come thru to wish me a happy birthday! üéÇ\n\n  WHO: You\, and hopefully many of your friends that you‚Äôll bring\n\n  WHAT: Vi‚Äôs Birthday Triple Header Happy Hour combination corporate LGBTQ+ happy hour plus birthday celebration plus Killer Queen Open Hive Night\n\n  WHERE: Wonderville\n\n1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY\n\nhttps://Wonderville.nyc/\n\n  DIRECTIONS: https://g.page/wondervillenyc\n\n  WHEN: Tuesday\, July 5th\n\n  5pm-2:30am: Vi‚Äôs happy birthday celebration!\n\n5pm-9pm: LGBTQ Employee Resource Group Happy Hour and (limited) open bar!\n\n8pm-12am: Killer Queen Open Hive Night\n\n  If you haven‚Äôt already been there\, Wonderville is a free-play indie arcade studio üïπÔ∏è and combination bar with two DJ booths\, a stage\, a backyard\, and numerous wonderful queer events every week. It is easily accessible from downtown Manhattan via the [J] Subway train and numerous buses and one of my favorite queer spots ever! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è\n\n  LGBTQ+ ERG ‚ÄúHOW WAS YOUR PRIDE?‚Äù HAPPY HOUR:\n\n5pm-9pm\n\n  Join Vi and her work colleagues for a sponsored post-Pride Month ‚ÄúHow was your Pride?‚Äù Happy Hour. Come meet other queers and allies from her work\, their friends\, and more of Vi‚Äôs friends as we share our Pride Month stories and meet new folks who are gearing up for the sequel of ‚ÄúHot Vaxxx Summer\,‚Äù ‚ÄúHot Vaxxx Summer 2: I Wanna Know What You Did Last Pride!‚Äù\n\n  This event is not exclusive to Vi‚Äôs LGBTQ+ coworkers so everyone is welcome but (obviously?) is focused on making sure we create a space for LGBTQ+ employees with support from our allies. There will also be a limited open tab courtesy the company Employee Resource Group and employee experience team for this happy hour as well and some remaining portions of the tab will be picked up by Tech Learning Collective as a thank you to the queer community who keep coming to our workshops. That said\, please feel free to donate to Tech Learning Collective if you have the means to help support our work.\n\n\n\n  VI‚ÄôS HAPPY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION:\n\n5pm-2:30am\n\n  It‚Äôs my birthday! I‚Äôll be 1 year old\, as my HRT anniversary is right around the corner! Come wish me a happy birthday at one of my favorite venues in all of New York City\, and where I‚Äôm going to be anyway\, Wonderville! Don‚Äôt worry about bringing a gift or anything like that\, just bring your amazing self and be ready for a ‚Äúworlds collide‚Äù moment because I‚Äôm inviting my co-workers (who know me by a different name and everything) so let‚Äôs see how that goes\, lol?\n\n  You‚Äôll get to see a glimpse of me as the corporate!Vi version of myself\, and they‚Äôll get to see a glimpse of the trans hacker party princess!Vi version of me! It‚Äôll be great! Or a complete disaster that will fuck up my life forever! I‚Äôm ready for either!\n\n  KILLER QUEEN OPEN HIVE NIGHT:\n\n8pm-12am\n\n  Come learn how to play the popular 10-player arcade game from some of NYC‚Äôs best players\, including the scene‚Äôs newest hypersocial up and coming hottie Queen Bee\, yours truly! We‚Äôll be playing Killer Queen in open play and maybe a round-robin tournament mode\, so come early to find teammates and sign up for the casual tournament.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Queer hackers of the world\, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to Hex90‚Äôs latest queer hacker salon\, ‚ÄúPromiscuous Mode\,‚Äù hosted at Wonderville\, where you can buy tickets.\n\nlog tcp !192.168.0/24 any -&gt\; 192.168.0.2 (msg: "QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD\, UNITE" \; )\ntail /var/log/PROMISCUOUS.MODE\nAug 13 21:00 hex90 syslogd[135]: QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD\, UNITE\n\nHEX90 ‚Äî a queer hacker salon in NYC\n\nIt is time for us to reach the sky! By sunlight and moonlight\, take flight! Let us imagine ourselves as stardust returning to our celestial origins\, intertwingled together. We will burn the stars with our radiance!\n\nHackers are elemental. Like water\, we are shapeless\, yet we are every shape. We transition between states as our environment changes\, changing the environment in the process. We can be as hard as ice\, or as soft as flame. Opaque\, or invisible\, or spanning everything in between\, we are the cloud. Ours is flesh that forms as quickly as it may float away. Impenetrable\, or permeable. Our bodies\, our choices\, from one fluid moment to the next.\n\nInformation packets traverse the ether. Netflows quickly vanish over the horizon. There are traces of fire on the wire connecting our vibrating crystalline bodies. Sniff the wire to prime your electronic memory with the sounds of conversations past and present. Enter promiscuous mode\, spread your wings\, and fly to the stars with us!\n\ninfo_\n\nAugust 13\, 2022 @ Wonderville\n1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY 11221\n9:00pm ‚Äî 3:00am\n\n~ this venue is accessible\n~ this venue has gender-neutral restrooms\n~ this venue has outdoor space\n\n# dressing up is encouraged but not required\n\nfeaturing_\n\n~ music performances by\n~~ Kandylion\n~~ DJ Softserve\n~ livecoded visuals by\n~~ Char Stiles (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ Voyde\n~~ gwenpri.me (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ schwaz (Livecode.NYC)\n~ algorave and electronic audio by\n~~ Alanza\n~~ alsoknownasrox (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ Azhad Syed (Livecode.NYC)\n~~ dan.dog\n~ indie games by Death By Audio Arcade\n~ hacking demos &amp\; education by Tech Learning Collective\n~ text adventure cybersecurity game by Shift-CTRL Space\n\nDANCE AT THE STAGE\, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!\n\nIn addition to music and visuals\, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop\, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue\, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer\," the game is not available on the public Internet.)\n\nAfter you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network\, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges\, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance\, applied cryptography\, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor\, and there's no high quite like it.\n\nWe continuously add levels to the game\, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover\, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue\, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords\, QR codes stashed in unexpected places\, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all\, and so on. At Hex90\, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.\n\nAll of the tools\, techniques\, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.\n\n#------------------#\n# START HACKING AT #\n#------------------#\nhttps://hex90.party\n\n#------------------#\n# BUY TICKETS HERE #\n#------------------#\nhttps://www.wonderville.nyc/events/hex90-promiscuous-mode\n\nSUPPORTER TIER:\n$30 - pay if you can\n\nADVANCE TICKETS:\n$15.00 - str8 cismen\n$10.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\nDAY-OF/AT THE DOOR:\n$20.00 - str8 cismen\n$15.00 - queers/transes/enbies and femmes\n\n/**\n* Hex90 is an inclusive event.\n* Door staff is instructed to respect your self-identification.\n*/\n\nNOTICE:\nThis is an intentionally queer space.

Our ethics place us against ‚ÄúAdtech\,‚Äù ‚ÄúFintech\,‚Äù and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth\, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one‚Äôs actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism\, sterility\, and authoritarianism by being participatory\, flexible\, and adaptive.\n\nAbout XOXA\n\nXOXA (pronounced ex-oh-ex-ay) is a Brooklyn based queer collective of DJs\, artists and performers founded in 2017. Their mission is to provide a supportive platform for women and LGBTQ+ artists to perform while creating an intentional party space for women\, non-binary and trans individuals.

Her versatile and melodic mixes span genres and decades with an emphasis on feel-good house\, disco\, acid and breaks.\n\nAbout DJ Softserve\n\nStarting his DJ journey in South Korea\, DJ Softserve has since played in major festivals\, clubs and bars all over South Korea and the US. He is committed to creating the most fun dancefloor possible and blasts the frostiest beats for only the coolest homies.\n\nAbout LiveCode.NYC\n\nWe are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics\, games\, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group\, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding\, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this\, as a collective.\n\nAbout Char Stiles\n\nChar describes how photons work to sand that thinks\, that is to say she livecodes GLSL visuals on the computer\, that is to say she writes constantly compiling graphics algorithms on the GPU as a performance. This is in hopes it is entertainment.\n\nAbout Voyde\n\nIndira/Voyde uses Unreal Engine in creating surreal landscapes made of liquid bodies\, journalistic images\, and narrative snapshots hidden deep inside\, scrambled with voronoi.\n\nAbout gwenpri.me\n\ngwenpri.me is a creative technologist\, artist\, and livecoder. She makes live visuals from videos\, pictures\, emoji\, text\, and more\, then composites them using live code techniques. She enjoys finding arcane ways to put pixels on screens. Past sets have included touch designer patching\, Lua DSLs\, command line video editors\, and more.\n\nAbout Alanza\n\nAlanza is a polymath based in New York. Her music ranges from hardware improvisation to in-the-box pop production.
