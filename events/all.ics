LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop is a practical introduction to creating\, using\, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you’ve never heard of a virtual machine before\, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren’t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity\, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software\, and much more!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so\, no matter what you’re doing on your computer\, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example\, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes\, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing\, or “containerizing\,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.\n\n  Today\, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers\, servers\, and global data networks work\, and cross-platform\, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by VeraCrypt)\, network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g.\, using VLANs) or even the whole Internet (using INetSim)\, processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g.\, in QEMU)\, and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by Proxmox). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features\, such as in the Qubes Operating System\, macOS’s App Sandbox\, and Firefox Containers.\n\n  Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit\, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the VirtualBox type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly\, browse the Web more safely\, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers\, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure\, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems\, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist\, like inception\, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Master the fundamentals of personal and enterprise-grade network firewalls in this hands-on workshop about network perimeter security. By learning to use the macOS\, Windows\, BSD\, and Linux firewalls (including command-line utilities like iptables\, nft\, and pfctl)\, you can protect your devices even on untrustworthy or hostile networks\, like public Wi-Fi. Intended for all audiences\, you’ll gain experience with both beginner-friendly and advanced tools like pfSense as you get an introduction to a wide range of NetSec scenarios. We’ll also cover the important security properties of NAT routers\, how deep packet inspection (DPI) works\, and get you started with industry-standard Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) like Snort.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s ubiquitous computing environment\, the most frequently used entrance (and exit!) in to (or out of) any system is its network connection. That’s why network firewalls have been a central component of every network security architecture since their introduction in the 1980’s. A firewall’s primary responsibility is to stop the spread of malware\, help prevent cyberattacks and unauthorized data exfiltration\, or isolate other problems in one network or network segment from affecting others. Thus\, firewalls serve to compartmentalize one area of a computer network from another. And while they are most commonly thought of as being at network boundaries like your home or office router\, just about every computer has a firewall these days\, including your personal laptop.\n\n  Modern firewalls can also do a lot more than their first or second generation ancestors that simply blocked certain ports or kept track of ongoing conversations between two endpoints. By building on so-called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology\, firewalls can analyze the traffic passing through them in real time\, making decisions about what to allow or block based on myriad factors. On more heavily policed or otherwise protected networks\, firewalls have evolved into very powerful Network Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).\n\n  But don’t make the mistake of thinking this power is reserved for rich corporations! The firewall built into the Linux kernel (called Netfilter and controlled with the iptables or nft commands) is the backbone of almost all commercial enterprise firewall distributions\, and it’s available free of charge. Plus\, its ability to intercept and modify traffic in-flight is the basis of many proxy technologies such as Docker’s networking and Kubernetes’s kube-proxy\, among others.\n\n  So\, are your network shields up? Find out at this workshop where we’ll show you how to use the firewall built-in to your Windows\, macOS\, or GNU/Linux laptop. We’ll also show you how to set up firewalled subnets using NAT routers\, a bulletproof way to keep unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) or smart-home devices from infecting your more critical personal devices\, or to make a super-secure guest Wi-Fi network available for visitors. You’ll leave understanding the utility of so-called Layer 7 firewalls such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\, and knowing how to test the security of your own firewall configurations.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can help you evade Internet censorship\, protect your network traffic\, and offer easier access to remote services on firewalled internal networks. You’ll learn how to set up and use OpenVPN\, a free and widely-deployed VPN solution\, so that you can connect securely to your home\, office\, or other provider’s networks no matter where you are and no matter who’s watching you. Using a VPN can also make it appear that you are accessing the Internet from a location other than where you are\, which means it’s simple to access some files or services that would otherwise be blocked where you live.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How often have you wished you could be in two places at once? That’s exactly what Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology was designed to allow computers to do. First popularized in 1996 by Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)\, using VPN technology made it possible for two disconnected networks to be knit back together into one as long as each of them were connected to a third middle network\, even if that middle network was hostile or untrusted. Today\, that middle network is usually the Internet\, which can certainly be hostile and untrusted! With a VPN\, it’s possible to be “here” (on your actual network) and “there” (on the other side of the VPN connection) at the same time\; by signing into a VPN service\, you create a “VPN tunnel” that acts like a wormhole in space-time in that whatever you send into the tunnel emerges on the other side as though the two sides of the tunnel are next to each other.\n\n  Throughout the late 1990’s and 2000’s\, VPN technology saw a surge in use among businesses looking for ways to enable remote workers. Using VPNs made it simpler for a colleague to travel because they could still be “directly connected” to their office network. By 2001\, the OpenVPN project made this amazing technology free and open source for GNU/Linux systems\, with cross-platform implementations for Mac OS X and Windows arriving shortly thereafter. Today\, OpenVPN servers form the bedrock of many modern free and commercial VPN solutions\, and are still the most widely deployed VPN solution for most use cases.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get to see what happens when network packets are sent into VPN tunnels and how they appear on the other side in order to learn exactly how VPNs encapsulate—and secure—your computer’s communication with Web sites\, office servers\, or other services. You’ll see what it takes to set up your own OpenVPN server (not much!)\, as well as how to troubleshoot connection issues. You’ll also get introduced to several newer but less mature VPN protocols such as Wireguard\, and learn about Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN solutions such as IPsec and its related tunneling (L2TP) and security (ESP\, IKE\, etcetera) protocols.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get your message out without revealing who you are by publishing anonymously on the “Darknet.” This workshop shows you how to create Tor Onion services for Web sites through free tools like OnionShare\, and even by setting up Tor servers that are built and configured from scratch manually. You’ll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online\, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass\, fingerprint correlation\, and other similar attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  It’s often said that if you want to tell people the truth\, you’d better make them laugh—or they’ll kill you. Sometimes\, humor isn’t a sufficient defense. For these situations\, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing\, you’ll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or\, if you’re really skilled\, completely anonymously.\n\n  Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet\, with “real name” requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook\, law enforcement agents demanding travelers’ online usernames and passwords at border crossings\, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies\, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals\, and so too do politically vocal bloggers\, investigative journalists\, and citizens.\n\n  In this specialized workshop\, you’ll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road\, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times\, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You’ll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services\, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers\, network relays\, and Tor’s famous onion-routing protocol.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Find out how easy it is to avoid certain forms of Internet censorship\, phishing attacks\, or network outages in this primer to the Domain Name System or DNS. Far from being just a way to translate names like Google.com into IP addresses\, the DNS is actually a massively distributed\, delegated database capable of housing all sorts of information. For administrators and programmers\, understanding DNS is a crucial step to ensuring the health of applications and services. But it’s also one of the components of Internet networking most visible to users. This workshop will discuss recursive resolvers\, anti-spam DNS resource records\, and state-of-the-art security protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the digital world of cyperspace networks\, such as the Internet\, places don’t have names. They have numbers. Called Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\, these numbers are used to identify the sources and destinations where network traffic\, such as Web browsing\, email\, and video conferencing messages should go. But if computers use numbers and not names to route traffic\, how do they know where to go when we type in addresses such as google.com in our Web browser?\n\n  The answer lies in DNS\, the Domain Name System. Often described as “the Internet’s phone book\,” DNS is actually a far more capable and integral component of networked systems than it’s given credit for. Ever since its inception in 1983\, the DNS was a key enabler of the growth of the Internet and has been vital to its continued operation to this day. Beyond the popular understanding as a name-to-address lookup system\, the DNS is actually a massive\, distributed\, delegated database that allows organizations to publish all kinds of useful information in the form of resource records (RRs). For instance\, today DNS is also used to fight email spam and phishing attacks (using DNS-backed protocols like SPF\, DKIM\, DMARC\, and DANE\, and CAA resource records)\, perform service discovery (with SRV records)\, and more.\n\n  Understanding what DNS really is and how it actually works is a crucial\, early step administrators must take to ensure applications and services are healthy. In this deep-dive workshop\, we’ll dissect the DNS protocol itself\, watching queries and replies\, and we’ll trace DNS messages across recursive DNS servers\, called resolvers\, as they get bounced from the root DNS resolvers to the ultimate authority responsible for managing the zone in which our answer is to be found. We’ll also discuss the inherent insecurities of the original UDP-based DNS traffic\, as well as how to secure DNS transmissions using state-of-the-art technology such as DNSCrypt v2\, DNS-over-TLS (DoT)\, and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)\, which is increasingly finding its way into familiar apps like Web browsers and even the Windows 10 Operating System itself.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to collect\, generate\, and manipulate data of all kinds so that you can make decisions and meet the challenges you’re facing. You’ll see how simple\, text-based data files and command-line utilities have been and are still being used in all sorts of applications today\, what spreadsheets have to offer\, and how all these tools differ from Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) like MySQL/MariaDB\, PostgreSQL\, Oracle\, or Microsoft SQL Server. This workshop will also touch on Web scraping\, form building\, mail merges\, data cleaning\, and other techniques you need to know to make automating the boring parts of your day possible.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If knowledge is power\, what is knowledge? On a computer\, knowledge comes from data. By collecting data relevant to the problem you’re trying to solve\, you can scrutinize it in various different ways until you’re able to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset\; you turn data into information\, and from that information you gain knowledge\, which gives you power. But this is all much easier said than done\, especially if you are not already familiar with how to work with digital data.\n\n  This workshop introduces you to the concepts and techniques you need to know to collect\, generate\, and manipulate digital information regardless of the specific application or problem domain you’re working in. Ever since the dawn of computing\, data has been a central element in computer use. After all\, what good is a computer without data to compute? Early databases took the form of stacks of physical punch cards. Later on\, databases were created out of structured text files (and many of these still exist on your computer today\, whether you realize it or not). With the advent of “personal” computing in the 1980’s\, digital spreadsheets in applications like Lotus 1-2-3 brought enterprise automation solutions to the masses—or it would have\, if more people had the opportunity to learn how to use these powerful tools.\n\n  Today\, massive datasets with billions or trillions of records are often stored in Relational Database Management Systems (RDMSs) and are accessed using specialized computer languages such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). These databases are thus the crown jewels of every company or organization conducting business online. Everything that matters to them gets stored in a database of some kind\, from email subscriber lists\, customer records\, call logs\, and purchase orders\, to social media postings\, blog comments\, personal photos\, and much more. Practice working with different kinds of data to learn the foundations relevant to all data exploration and transformation tasks in this introductory workshop that will help you ensure you can get the right stuff to construct successful solutions to any problem.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come exploring with us as we show you how to map out interconnections between computers\, trace packet routes across network gateways\, and find information about network operators. In this workshop all about the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments\, we use tools like nmap to send probes into cyberspace and tap into the wire with Wireshark to understand how they function.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace\, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace\, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!\n\n  These are the voyages of frames\, packets\, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way\, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices\, such as routers\, firewalls\, traffic inspectors\, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey\, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next\, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as nmap along with digital wiretapping tools like Wireshark we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.\n\n  Join us to explore strange new networks\, to seek out new devices and new organizations\, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of website security auditing in this hands-on workshop that will introduce you to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free\, open source Web application security scanner and intercepting proxy. We’ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process\, you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  According to Douglas Crockford\, former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that\, “The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.” Given that it’s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place\, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken\, hacked\, and exploited? Of course\, it’s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break into (or\, break out of) that system.\n\n  The “front door” to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you’ll learn exactly how attackers\, internal Red Teams\, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites\, identifying vulnerabilities\, and exploiting them. By using the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)\, a free and open source Web application security scanner\, you’ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics\, intercepting proxy configuration\, target scoping\, and more. We’ll be targeting the OWASP Juice Shop\, an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the OWASP Top Ten. They include SQL injection\, sensitive data exposure\, cross-site scripting (XSS)\, broken authentication and access control\, and many others.\n\n  Today’s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground\, economically\, militarily\, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use—or even build!—can be made to fail in just the “right” way\, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do\, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords\, install malware on your systems\, or penetrate your network.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:BitTorrent\, the wildly popular but often maligned file sharing protocol\, is now being used in everything from (legal!) video streaming sites to corporate software update servers\, but you wouldn’t know that if you only listened to Big Media groups like the RIAA. In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. You’ll see how next generation “decentralized” Web applications are making use of the technology\, how companies like Facebook and Blizzard\, Inc. use it every day\, how to make your own “torrents” to share files of your own\, and how and why some people take protective measures to torrent more privately.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  If you’ve heard anything about “downloading free movies on the Internet\,” you probably heard of BitTorrent or its more colloquial synonym\, “torrents.” You have also probably heard of companies threatening BitTorrent users with Internet service bans\, financial penalties\, and even lawsuits for “stealing intellectual property.“ Through expensive and coordinated disinformation campaigns\, companies like Disney and other “Big Content” media conglomerates represented by special interest groups like the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have linked BitTorrent with music and movie piracy in the public mind. They continue to try convincing people that BitTorrent is hard\, immoral\, and unsafe to use\, but the reality is far less one-sided.\n\n  BitTorrent refers to a file transfer technology that has been around since 2001 and is designed to make it easy for you to more quickly share very large files across a computer network\, even if your computer lacked a high-speed Internet connection. It worked so well that by the end of 2013 there were more than a quarter billion individual BitTorrent users on the Internet. While the media painted this as an epidemic of criminal behavior\, most BitTorrent uses were and still are both legal and mundane. Moreover\, the heaviest BitTorrent users were actually companies who built the technology into their own products\, such as Blizzard\, Inc. (the World of WarCraft company)\, who used BitTorrent to deliver updates of its game software to players.\n\n  Today\, BitTorrent is still one of the most popular\, cost-efficient\, and speediest large-file transfer technologies available to both individuals and multinational corporations alike. Cash-strapped Free Software projects such as GNU/Linux distributions use BitTorrent to distribute their installation packages in order to reduce their monthly bandwidth bills\, a whole new category of “decentralized Web” applications like ZeroNet are using BitTorrent under the hood to make Web publishing easier and more censorship-resistant than ever before\, and traditional Web sites with large bandwidth requirements like video streaming sites (e.g.\, PeerTube) are increasingly adopting a newer variant called WebTorrent to improve download speeds and interoperate with the massive existing BitTorrent network.\n\n  In this beginner-friendly workshop\, we’ll bust BitTorrent myths and set the record straight about what “torrenting” actually is\, how it works\, and what you can do with it. Learn how to find\, download\, and even create your own torrents so you can share files with friends and colleagues regardless of network obstacles like firewalls or NAT routers. Bring a laptop and you’ll be able to participate in a (legal and safe!) BitTorrent “swarm.” We’ll also discuss the implications of using BitTorrent for less-than-legal ends\, and demonstrate steps you can take to improve your privacy such as enabling BitTorrent encryption\, connecting to trackers through public proxies and Virtual Private Networks\, and building private seedboxes.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This workshop shows you how to keep your emails private regardless of what email provider you use. By learning how to use the freely and widely available Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cryptosystem in email\, you will see how easy it is to not only encrypt messages so that they remain confidential\, but also how to make sure the emails you get were really sent by the people they claim to be from. Once you’re able to verify the sender of email you receive\, you’re far less likely to get caught up in an email phishing scam ever again.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As one of the oldest digital communication methods\, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does\, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective\, it’s more like “e-postcards” because\, just like sending a postcard through the postal service\, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.\n\n  In the physical world\, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way\, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world\, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services\, like ProtonMail\, claim to do this for you\, but fail to do so in many common scenarios. Meanwhile\, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google\, but this isn’t always true either.\n\n  This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using freely available OpenPGP-compatible software\, which has been available since 1991\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Most individuals with access to a computer system have more power today than ever before\, but rarely do they make use of it or even know how much power they truly have. In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll begin learning how to “speak with the machines.” By learning to communicate more expressively with the digital devices that are increasingly responsible for mediating contemporary society\, you’ll gain the power to effectively and materially change your relationship not only with your laptop\, but with global systems of law\, finance\, and even art\, literature\, and philosophy governing today’s world.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous\, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.\n\n  Modern computers are power tools\, and behind each one of them is a human operator\, or “system administrator\,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone\, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date\, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos\, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.\n\n  In this beginner’s workshop\, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files\, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called daemons\, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors\, they make up the world of Operating System services\, signals\, sockets\, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer\, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to make your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\, automatically install software on the servers in your cloud\, and write executable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance with the press of a button. With today’s modern automation toolkits\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company\, as long as they use the right tools the right way. In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation with tools like Ansible\, Vagrant\, and Terraform\, and a chance to solidify your understanding of fundamental DevOps skills that every IT professional needs.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In today’s IT environments\, application servers\, databases\, file shares\, and even network devices are too numerous for any individual or team to provision\, configure\, and administer one at a time. To deploy\, maintain\, and secure large digital fleets\, site reliability engineers leverage the inherent power of computerized automation to perform everything from daily tasks (patching\, updating code) to critical but rare operations (migrations\, incident response). But even small groups can take advantage of this sort of automation to massively amplify their impact\; today\, a two-person hobby project can outperform a 100-person company if they use the right tools the right way.\n\n  Generically called Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\, modern configuration management tools like Ansible\, Chef\, SaltStack\, and Puppet make it possible for a single operator to paralellize executing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) like initiating backups or performing blue-green deployments on hundreds or thousands of machines at once. By using virtualization through IaC tools like Vagrant\, entire “cloud” environments can be emulated for heterogenous development teams\, massively streamlining everything from software development\, to R&amp\;D\, to education and onboarding. (Tech Learning Collective’s own course exercises and practice labs are defined in code as Vagrant configurations!) Encoding your organization’s infrastructure requirements in standard\, vendor-neutral\, open formats such as Terraform means you can switch from one infrastructure provider to another with ease. But perhaps most important of all\, “automating all the things” means that potential disasters like ransomware extortion attempts\, outages\, or even mere accidents can be audited\, diagnosed\, and remediated in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll get a practical introduction to cloud infrastructure automation. You’ll learn how to create your first virtual private cloud (VPC)\, add multiple machines to it\, automatically install server software on those machines\, and write exectuable runbooks to automatically perform upgrades and other maintenance tasks on your new infrastructure. Whether you’re already administering a fleet of servers at work\, or just want to slim your “weekend project” time down to size\, this far-reaching workshop will solidify your understanding of the development operations (DevOps) skills every IT professional needs to hone to have success with modern digital infrastructure projects.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice.
