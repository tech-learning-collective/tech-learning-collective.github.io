DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to pilot Kubernetes and find out how it helps you get the most value out of your hardware. Kubernetes is the free\, enterprise-grade\, cloud-native solution for automated deployment\, scaling\, and management of containerized applications. This workshop offers an introduction to container orchestration concepts and practices by showing you how to work effectively with kubectl\, utilize Labels and Selectors\, explore various components of the Kubernetes control plane\, and more. You’ll get your own Kubernetes cluster where you can deploy apps\, learn how to influence scheduling decisions\, and monitor the health of clustered workloads.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  As anyone who has ever moved house knows\, the more effectively you can pack\, the easier your move will be. It’s a big task\, often requiring thousands of tiny decisions to make sure delicate items are wrapped appropriately\, all one’s stuff fits neatly into all the available boxes\, and so on. Once the boxes are all packed\, loading them onto a moving vehicle requires that you distribute their weight more or less evenly so that there are no unpleasant surprises during the move. This is more or less what container orchestration tools are for\, except instead of moving physical bins\, we have to ship software inside containers. Each container requires resources\, like CPU time and memory space\, which means we’ll need to play a sort of Tetris game to make sure all our containers fit in the most dense\, yet most balanced\, arrangement to keep our hardware costs as low as possible.\n\n  Kubernetes is the free and open source industry standard container orchestration platform that provides both system administrators and application developers with a set of tools for cooperatively building\, deploying\, and maintaining applications at all levels of scale. Its job is to help you get the most out of your hardware by “packing” all your containers (installed server software) into the fewest possible “bins” (physical or virtual machines)\, and then automatically monitoring\, restarting\, adding\, removing\, or shuffling those containers from one machine to another as demand for the services running on your cluster change. Your job is to tell Kubernetes what your ideal deployment situation is\, and what to prioritize when resources get scarce.\n\n  In this intermediate-level workshop\, we’ll build on our knowledge of Linux containers and fundamental system administration tasks to explore a Kubernetes cluster. You’ll learn how to inspect workloads using the kubectl command line utility\, a graphical Web-based dashboard\, and the Kubernetes API itself. By exploring the Kubernetes control plane\, you’ll get insight into how Kubernetes makes scheduling decisions and\, along with using Labels and Selectors\, you’ll learn how to influence those scheduling decisions by tainting certain resources in specific ways. Finally\, you’ll see how Kubernetes provides a set of “cloud-native” services and APIs that developers can use to write apps that spawn more replicas of themselves when needed and perform other forms of automated or self-healing tasks\, making the system administrator’s job that much easier.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of computer networking in this workshop that starts by watching a “conversation” between two computers as it’s happening in real time. You’ll be introduced to the free professional network analysis application called Wireshark so that you can listen in on what the programs on your computer are saying to or hearing from other computers across the Internet. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens “on the wire” when you’re browsing a Web site\, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection\, this is the class for you!\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Our ability to browse Web sites\, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages\, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made\, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud\,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see\, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house\, and others you can’t\, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.\n\n  In this workshop derived from a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course\, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive\, Facebook\, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called Wireshark\, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data\, emitting it onto a network\, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network\, such as DHCP server misconfigurations\, ARP spoofing attacks\, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Remote
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to inscribe your thoughts\, dreams\, and desires into your computer and take your command line skills to the next level by learning how to write simple programs called shell scripts. In a way\, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively\, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs\, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  At their core\, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper\, they allow us to record our thoughts\, dreams\, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper\, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible\, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors\, industrial control systems\, biomedical devices\, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharge every facet of our humanity.\n\n  When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer\, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose\, text-only interface called a command line. Individually\, these instructions are called invocations. (Yes\, that’s their technical term!) In this beginner’s workshop\, you’ll learn how to write whole spells\, rituals\, or (sacred) texts called shell scripts to inscribe your own thoughts\, dreams\, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.\n\n  By saving your scripts in files\, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and\, as such\, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work\, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:This beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety will cut through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle\, and offer an opportunity to ask your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions. By learning about foundational frameworks that cybersecurity professionals use to assess risk and safety such as the CIA triad and the three states of data\, you’ll build an understanding of information security from first principles to advanced techniques. By the end of this workshop\, you will be able to apply these building blocks to anything and everything you do online\, or in the streets.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds\, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts\,” how do you know which tool to use\, when\, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really should use\, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover\, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself\, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?\n\n  This beginner’s workshop taught by the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers offers a simple framework anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective\, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City\, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money\, people\, etcetera) does my attacker have?”\n\n  Although there are many good and free tools available\, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like Signal)\, a password manager (like KeePass or Bitwarden\, and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers\, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short\, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear\, uncertainty\, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place\, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you should take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn to manage your own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) datacenter environment and make the most of cloud infrastructure providers (“IaaS platforms”) by automatically deploying underlying infrastructure\, including network topology\, firewall rulesets\, DNS records\, and other resources. This intermediate-level workshop introduces you to Terraform\, a free\, agentless\, masterless\, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) digital operations provisioning tool used by many of the largest organizations in the world but simple enough to use on a team of one.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  In the beginning\, there was the mainframe: a single\, gigantic machine that held all the data and did all the work by itself\, like a digital planet suspended in the vast emptiness of cyberspace. Then came networks\, the personal computer\, the Internet\, Web 2.0\, cloud computing\, microservices\, and containers—a whole cybergalaxy to explore. While the world today looks very different than it did in the days of the mainframe\, every project still needs to start at the beginning: get at least one computer to hold all project data and do all project work. So how do modern projects go from a single computer to a whole galaxy so quickly?\n\n  For many (including Tech Learning Collective!)\, the answer is Terraform\, a free\, open source\, and extensible tool that can provision and manage any number of infrastructural resources from source code repositories to cloud compute instances to DNS records and much\, much more. Using Terraform\, engineers describe the digital environment they’d like to have by writing it down in a simple\, declarative configuration language called HCL. Then\, when instructed\, Terraform does the work of metaphorically\, well\, terraforming cyberspace to match the engineer’s description.\n\n  In this workshop\, you’ll learn the basics of how to set up Terraform for your organization. We’ll also go over best practices for ensuring testing\, staging\, and production infrastructures stay isolated from one another\, how to compose reusable modules\, and how to share your Terraform configurations as well as project state with collaborators. At the end of this workshop\, you’ll understand how to bring the cloud down to earth.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters\, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet\, make censored websites available again\, and even let you host your own Internet services for free\, all without opening a single port on your firewall!\n\n  In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication\, target service load balancing\, and NAT-punching. In the process\, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class\, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone\; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie\, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Get an accessible introduction to the basics of password management by learning how to perform a password cracking attack yourself. Learn exactly what Web sites do with your password when you log in\, how to find out if you have been “pwned\,” what the risks are\, and what you can do to protect yourself from brute-force\, credential stuffing\, and other forms of account takeover attacks.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Have you been “pwned”? For years\, security researcher Troy Hunt has been running a website at HaveIBeenPwned.com that lets you check to see if your online accounts have been pwned—that is\, if your personal information such as your password\, has been leaked\, accessed\, or (worst of all!) “cracked.” Go on\, check for yourself!\n\n  If you’ve been “pwned\,” this workshop is your chance to learn exactly what the risk might be\, and what you can do about it. Derived from one portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” (Security 101) course\, this class will clarify the basics of cryptography and encryption within a context that actually applies to your day to day life online.\n\n\n\n  Learn what websites do with your password when you log in to them\, and why using free password management software can make you both safer and more productive. On the flip side\, learn professional techniques for recovering passwords from their “encrypted” (hashed) representation\, such as using optimized wordlists\, word-mangling rulesets\, and employing basic doxing techniques for creating personally targeted password-cracking attacks.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:To take full advantage of the Web\, especially as a digital publishing medium\, you need to start by using the full expressive power of its most fundamental part: the simple HTML “Web page.” This workshop covers HTML\, the HyperText Markup Language\, as though it were a language in which you can write poems as well as tables of facts and figures\, because it is! Learn how to structure your pages in digital rhyme and meter and find out why this approach results in better code for both beautiful designs and automated processes.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online\, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why\, then\, is it so rarely explained in terms of the language that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar\, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end\, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language\, and that includes HTML.\n\n  This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice\, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course\, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like Microdata and RDFa\, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find\, use\, and most importantly understand what you’re saying.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice.
