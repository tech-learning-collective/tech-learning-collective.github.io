DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn the basics of securing digital infrastructure by taking a deep-dive into the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol\, a fundamental component of safe administrative access to remote servers. Regardless of whether you rely on one or many thousands of servers to power your daily operations\, securely managing those machines is essential to the success of your efforts. This intermediate-level workshop shows you how to securely set up\, access\, and debug connection issues over the SSH protocol so that you’ll be ready to operate self-hosted digital infrastructure for yourself\, friends\, or comrades.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Every app you use—from messengers like Signal or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like WordPress and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and online maps—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone)\, or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”)\, no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services\, somewhere. So\, do you know where your servers are? If not\, you can’t know how safe your data is!\n\n  When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there\, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar\, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned\, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation\, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.\n\n  This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration\, Networking\, and Security courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup\, monitoring\, and maintenance. By taking a deep dive into the SSH protocol\, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way\, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers\, Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks\, and much more. By the end of this workshop\, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself\, your friends\, and your comrades\, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice. We offer unparalleled free\, by-donation\, and low-cost computer classes on topics ranging from fundamental computer literacy to the same offensive computer hacking techniques used by national intelligence agencies and military powers (cyber armies).

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Learn how to beat back configuration drift on your servers by leveraging automation tools like Ansible in this deep dive workshop demonstrating modern DevOps practices for deploying\, maintaining\, and auditing compute clusters. Whether for a Web application\, big data processing\, or other project\, you need to turn old-school runbooks into computerized playbooks that can execute Standard Operating Procedures quickly and reliably so you can deploy complex systems simply and predictably. Come learn about key concepts like idempotence and change control\, and learn how giant corporations implement security principles like RBAC\, all using free and open source software.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  Today\, all but the most trivial of computer systems rely on an interdependent set of servers working in concert. You don’t just have one server\, you have a group of them. Commonly called a cluster\, these servers need to be managed as a group\, ensuring that their software configurations\, security patches\, and installed packages are deployed\, maintained\, and eventually updated or retired in a predictable way.\n\n  In this deep dive workshop\, we’ll set up our own small cluster and use Ansible\, which is an agentless\, cross-platform\, enterprise-grade\, free software Configuration Management (CM) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework used by giant corporations like IBM and Cisco\, to turn old-school operator runbooks into computerized playbooks that can be executed quickly and easily even by novice operators. Through several hands-on exercises\, you’ll learn about the entire CM lifecycle from planning through auditing so that you understand critical CM concepts like idempotence\, change control\, and more\, which are common to all CM systems including Chef\, Puppet\, and Salt.\n\n  Along the way\, you’ll be exposed to key concepts such as containerization through Ansible’s support for automating container builds\, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Ansible’s AWX Project\, and more. By adopting configuration management workflows with tools like Ansible\, you can reduce operator errors\, and beat back configuration drift on any long-lived infrastructure components.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar\, if possible.\n\nIf you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera\, you will need to have and activate your own camera\, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly\, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants\, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone\, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.\n\nPlease refer to our workshops and webinars FAQ for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.\n\nAs with all Tech Learning Collective events\, racism\, queerphobia\, transphobia\, sexism\, “brogrammer\,” “manarchist\,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to our lightweight social rules for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice.

DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small. In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\n\n  From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters\, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet\, make censored websites available again\, and even let you host your own Internet services for free\, all without opening a single port on your firewall!\n\n  In this deep dive workshop on Tor\, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication\, target service load balancing\, and NAT-punching. In the process\, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class\, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone\; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie\, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.\n\n\nAs this is a remote/online-only event\, there is no physical class space\, but attendance is still limited to 15 students\, so purchase your ticket now to reserve your spot.\n\nTo participate in our webinars\, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY\, 11221\, United States
DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en;CHARSET=utf-8:Start Summer off with a bang. We’re not talking about fireworks (although those are nice\, too). We’re talking about our good friend and collaborator\, Vi’s incredible three-in-one party night. Vi has been an incredible source of knowledge\, inspiration\, and persistence throughout all of Tech Learning Collective history. In partnership with others\, she co-founded our school and continues to be involved in community efforts to increase the digital literacy and safety of queer and trans folks to this day.\n\nIn many past posts on our blog\, as well as across the Web in recorded podcasts and on Internet radio\, you can listen to her impassioned takes on Internet history and the future of technology\, its impact on marginalized groups\, and her critiques of Silicon Valley’s approaches to “making the world a better place” all while advocating for a more technologically savvy and self-empowered relationship with digital technology. Although an enigma to many\, she is nothing if not iconoclastic\, embodying the very best of the trans hacker stereotype.\n\nToday\, Vi plays double-duty as a full time employee back in Silicon Valley after a long personal struggle\, as well as remaining a core organizer for the Hex90 queer hacker parties in New York City\, an advisor to a number of anarchist tech collectives\, and of course a central figure in Tech Learning Collective operations. Vi is turning 1 year old soon\, as her HRT anniversary is around the corner and\, true to form\, she’s decided to turn her party into something more communal.\n\nDirect from Vi “like the text editor” herself:\n\n\n  Hi\, friends! Pride Month has come and gone but there’s one more (massive) celebration to be had!\n\n  Join me\, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess\, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event: the company I work for tapped me to organize a “How was your pride?” post-pride month Happy Hour\, and I’m combining it with my “birthday” party and the next Killer Queen Open Hive Night at Wonderville.\n\n  The “How was your Pride?” Happy Hour is for my co-workers in NYC\, and I’m inviting them all to combine forces with the NYC Killer Queen scene for their weekly Open Hive Night. That day is also my trans birthday celebration\, so all three events are happening in the same place at the same time\, all in one amazing evening!\n\n  Join me and other colleagues (LGBTQ+ and allies) on Tuesday\, July 5th\, 5PM through 9PM at Wonderville in the center of the queer universe in Brooklyn. That Tuesday\, come learn how to play the popular 10-player strategy arcade game “Killer Queen” from some of NYC’s best players and NYC’s newest Queen Bee\, yours truly! Come also to share Pride Month stories\, meet one another in physical space\, and meet more queer NYC locals. And of course\, also come thru to wish me a happy birthday! 🎂\n\n  WHO: You\, and hopefully many of your friends that you’ll bring\n\n  WHAT: Vi’s Birthday Triple Header Happy Hour combination corporate LGBTQ+ happy hour plus birthday celebration plus Killer Queen Open Hive Night\n\n  WHERE: Wonderville\n\n1186 Broadway\, Brooklyn\, NY\n\nhttps://Wonderville.nyc/\n\n  DIRECTIONS: https://g.page/wondervillenyc\n\n  WHEN: Tuesday\, July 5th\n\n  5pm-2:30am: Vi’s happy birthday celebration!\n\n5pm-9pm: LGBTQ Employee Resource Group Happy Hour and (limited) open bar!\n\n8pm-12am: Killer Queen Open Hive Night\n\n  If you haven’t already been there\, Wonderville is a free-play indie arcade studio 🕹️ and combination bar with two DJ booths\, a stage\, a backyard\, and numerous wonderful queer events every week. It is easily accessible from downtown Manhattan via the [J] Subway train and numerous buses and one of my favorite queer spots ever! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️\n\n  LGBTQ+ ERG “HOW WAS YOUR PRIDE?” HAPPY HOUR:\n\n5pm-9pm\n\n  Join Vi and her work colleagues for a sponsored post-Pride Month “How was your Pride?” Happy Hour. Come meet other queers and allies from her work\, their friends\, and more of Vi’s friends as we share our Pride Month stories and meet new folks who are gearing up for the sequel of “Hot Vaxxx Summer\,” “Hot Vaxxx Summer 2: I Wanna Know What You Did Last Pride!”\n\n  This event is not exclusive to Vi’s LGBTQ+ coworkers so everyone is welcome but (obviously?) is focused on making sure we create a space for LGBTQ+ employees with support from our allies. There will also be a limited open tab courtesy the company Employee Resource Group and employee experience team for this happy hour as well and some remaining portions of the tab will be picked up by Tech Learning Collective as a thank you to the queer community who keep coming to our workshops. That said\, please feel free to donate to Tech Learning Collective if you have the means to help support our work.\n\n\n\n  VI’S HAPPY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION:\n\n5pm-2:30am\n\n  It’s my birthday! I’ll be 1 year old\, as my HRT anniversary is right around the corner! Come wish me a happy birthday at one of my favorite venues in all of New York City\, and where I’m going to be anyway\, Wonderville! Don’t worry about bringing a gift or anything like that\, just bring your amazing self and be ready for a “worlds collide” moment because I’m inviting my co-workers (who know me by a different name and everything) so let’s see how that goes\, lol?\n\n  You’ll get to see a glimpse of me as the corporate!Vi version of myself\, and they’ll get to see a glimpse of the trans hacker party princess!Vi version of me! It’ll be great! Or a complete disaster that will fuck up my life forever! I’m ready for either!\n\n  KILLER QUEEN OPEN HIVE NIGHT:\n\n8pm-12am\n\n  Come learn how to play the popular 10-player arcade game from some of NYC’s best players\, including the scene’s newest hypersocial up and coming hottie Queen Bee\, yours truly! We’ll be playing Killer Queen in open play and maybe a round-robin tournament mode\, so come early to find teammates and sign up for the casual tournament. Details also at:\n\nhttps://www.wonderville.nyc/events/killerqueen-07-05-2022\n\nhttps://killerqueenarcade.com/\n\n  Bring friends. Especially friends I don’t already know. &lt\;3 &lt\;3 &lt\;3 See you soon!\n\n\nAbout Tech Learning Collective\n\nTech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school that trains politically self-motivated individuals in the arts of hypermedia\, Information Technology\, and radical political practice.
