In addition to our intensive [courses]({% link courses/index.md %}), we also host satellite events such as [workshops]({% link workshops/index.md %}), skillshares, and demonstrations in collaboration with community centers, hackerspaces and hacklabs, and [other groups]({% link calendars/index.md %}) across New York City, and elsewhere via Internet video conference. These events are a low-commitment way to get a feel for our more intensive courses as well as meet some of our teaching team.

## Export Event Calendar

See all Tech Learning Collective events in your (Google/Apple/Microsoft/Mozilla/etcetera) calendar app! Simply click the link below:

{% include call-to-action-subscribe-to-calendar.html %}

If clicking the link does not open your calendaring application, it means your Web browser does not have a handler associated with the `webcal` scheme. You can either add this yourself, or simply use the Web address of our events&rsquo; iCalendar feed directly in your calendaring application by changing `webcal` to `https` in the URL:

[https://techlearningcollective.com/events/all.ics](https://techlearningcollective.com/events/all.ics)

Your calendaring application will also have instructions in its user manual for subscribing to calendars like ours. For example:

* [Google Calendar Support](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100)
* [Apple Calendar Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/subscribe-to-calendars-icl1022/mac)
* [Microsoft Outlook Support](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-Outlook-on-the-web-503ffaf6-7b86-44fe-8dd6-8099d95f38df)
* [Mozilla Thunderbird Lightning Calendar Support](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/creating-new-calendars#w_icalendar-ics)
* [Nextcloud Calendar documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/pim/calendar.html#subscribe-to-a-calendar)

Alternatively, you can [subscribe to the Atom feed for our events](https://techlearningcollective.com/feed/events.xml). If you use a news feed reader capable of consuming Atom feeds (all modern ones are), a new article will be added to this feed with the event details when we publish an event on our Web site.

Subscribing to one of our event feeds linked above guarantees that you won&rsquo;t miss your chance to participate in our free, by-donation, and low-cost public events.
