                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>A Dark Web workshop by and for Femmes and Allies</em>.</p>

<p>This digital safety workshop, open to all, is facilitated by the Tech Learning Collective’s femme cybersecurity instructors. It is a two-hour mini-intensive focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop, open to all, is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective’s intensive <a href="/courses/web101.html">WEB101 course</a>, is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced “front-end designers” will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites really are and how they’re made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

                <td><p>TechAhoy in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work</em>. This two-hour workshop is all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens when you’re browsing a website, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective is excited to collaborate with <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a> in facilitating <em>Network the Revolution: Building Alternative Internets</em>. In this presentation/discussion group hybrid, we will briefly discuss the concept of alternative networking for the purpose of self-hosted, unsurveillable communications, the <a href="https://github.com/shiftctrlspace/library">digital library project as fronted by Shift-CTRL</a>, how Shift-CTRL uses Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to organize themselves, the process of de-/re-programming Capitalist rhetorics on digital technology, and whatever else should happen to spontaneously arise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our situation today is this: every time we use the Internet, we are forced to accept that we are using the surveillance engine of advanced Capitalism in the Necrocene, a corporate-supported machine that consumes everything in its sights for the purpose of re-packaging it as benign. Situated at the brink of total climate collapse, the disenfranchised continue to be given insipid promises that in the Automation Revolution, “learning to code” at a “bootcamp” will set them free.</p>

  <p>As Anarchists, we recognize the nature of this false promise from the quicksand on which it is based.</p>

  <p>Revolutionaries in the West have either forgotten, corrupted, or else have never had a chance to find out what it might be like to harness the efficacy of digital technology for the benefit of radical social movements; many have abandoned the idea that this is even worthwhile.</p>

  <p>But there has actually never been a better time to revisit this assumption: hardware has never been more superfluous and less expensive, with brand new, fully functional computers costing $35 and running Free and Open Source Software, and the prevalence of overlay networks like Tor eking further into the public conscious.</p>

  <p>There is no chance now of reclaiming the mainstream Internet in its entirety (and perhaps there never was such a chance). But there has never been more opportunity than right now to create new systems, new internets, informed by new perspectives and approached holistically, for the purposes of revolutionary praxis.</p>

  <p>Shift-CTRL, a radical queer semi-elusive hacklab based in New York City, has plunged headfirst into the margins of this electronic dreamland with vicious dedication to the ideal of better potentials for organizing radical spaces, and are peering out now to talk about its humble beginnings and the state of a new intranet connecting radical spaces in the City.</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

This workshop is a variation on <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">our “Gone Phishing” workshop</a> geared especially for activists and others who are targeted by well-resourced adversaries such as law enforcement organizations (LEOs), national intelligence agencies, and private security contractors.</p>

<p>We will be in the Judson Memorial Church’s Garden room at  3:30 PM to help you learn how to defend against phishing, the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if your online accounts are bulletproof, you can still get caught out by a “phishing” attack that steals your private data, like your username and password. In fact, from corporate espionage to police entrapment, most cyberattacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, many people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam. Today, one and a half million new phishing websites are launched every month. Some are dragnets, while others are “watering hole” or even “spear phishing” attacks designed to target a specific demographic or even one individual high-value target (HVT). Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>In this hands-on digital workshop presented in collaboration with the radical queer and femme Tech Learning Collective, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers including law enforcement officers (LEOs) build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Interference Archive in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!</p>

  <p>These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code></a> along with digital wiretapping tools like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.</p>

  <p>Join us for a two-hour mission: to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Radical Infrastructure: Your First Physical Server</em>, a full day intensive workshop that will get you up and running with your own server that you can administer from anywhere in the world. This one-day class combines material from several TLC courses (<a href="/courses/sys101.html">SYS101</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">NET101</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">SEC101</a>) into a single project-based exercise in which you will build, install, and configure your own server, from the ground up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the first step in effective radical organizing is often escaping from the surveillance economy by using alternatives to popular online services such as Google’s GMail for email and Facebook’s Messenger for instant messaging. However, simply jumping to another company’s equivalent product is like moving your money out of one too-big-to-fail bank into another; it’s a lateral move at best. Thankfully, it’s way easier to start (or find) organizations that run alternative digital infrastructures than it is to start a new bank.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, you’ll be guided through the first steps of setting up just such an alternative infrastructure capable of providing a plethora of digital services to hundreds or even thousands of people. Since every app you use ultimately relies on a physical computer somewhere in the world offering services, that’s where we’ll start: plugging a server into a power outlet. From there, we’ll install an Operating System, learn the basics of remote administration over SSH, and start choosing services to run on our new server. By starting at the ground level, you can see for yourself exactly how tools like Google Calendar or <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> actually work—and how easy they are to replicate for free on the scale of a community or neighborhood network.</p>

  <p>Moreover, one of the best-kept secrets in tech is that most off-the-shelf computers can function remarkably well as servers. For example, the Raspberry Pi is one great example of such a device that cash-strapped advocacy groups can use to astonishingly powerful ends if only they had the know-how. (A single Raspberry Pi device retails for $35 USD!) This means that most small- to mid-sized organizations of a dozen to several hundred people can have their own truly self-owned and self-operated server infrastructures, completely independent from the Googles and Facebooks of the world, for only a few dozen dollars.</p>

  <p>Whether you or your group is using messagers like WhatsApp, publishing blog posts with WordPress, or using other coordination tools like online maps, ultimately, you’re using someone’s computer. Do you know whose computer you’re using? Do you know where your servers are? Knowing exactly where your data lives is a critical step on the path towards true autonomy, and by the end of this workshop you’ll be well on your way to operating your own fleet of devices with which to replace your reliance on the corporate “cloud.”</p>

<p><strong>Tickets</strong> are sold on a first-come, first-served basis and are only available via <a href="https://www.artful.ly/store/events/18622">our online storefront</a>.

<p><strong>Equipment</strong> will be provided in limited quantity for demo and exercise purposes only. We will have some Raspberry Pi devices that you can practice with, but if you want to leave class with your own physical server that you can install in your home, venue, or organizing space, you will need to purchase a hardware device to keep. We recommend <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775">purchasing a Raspberry Pi from AdaFruit</a>, along with the required peripheral hardware to complete the project at home: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995">a power supply</a>, an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294">8GB or larger SD card (hard disk)</a>, an SD card reader/writer compatible with your laptop, a generic USB keyboard (and optionally a USB mouse), an HDMI video cable, and an HDMI-capable video monitor.</p>

<p>If you’re not ready or able to purchase a Raspberry Pi, <em>you can still participate with just your laptop</em> because we will also be covering how to create virtual machines in software to simulate real hardware. This technique makes it possible to start learning the fundamentals without needing to make any additional hardware purchases. Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> if you have any further questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for, “<em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>.” This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Each month, the crew at Team Human NYC hosts a guest to lead a conversation of shared interest that reflects the Team Human values. This month, they’ve invited the Tech Learning Collective to learn about <a href="/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html">our unique technology education pedagogy</a>.</p>

<p>From the Team Human NYC description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This month we’ll speak with two instructors from the Tech Learning Collective. The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.</p>

  <p>While politicians and federal bureaucracy lead reactive policy against big-tech, The Tech Learning Collective asks a more fundamental question: how can we engage with computer technology outside the realms of capitalism? Should digital literacy step beyond how to “use” or “sell” technology, and into how to “own” and “share?”</p>

  <p>We’ll use this time together to explore The Tech Learning Collective and put our minds together to find how each of us can contribute towards this purpose.</p>

  <p>Learn more about The Tech Learning Collective here: <a href="https://techlearningcollective.com/about/">https://techlearningcollective.com/about/</a></p>

  <p>We’ll start the event meeting and catching-up. Our guest will share some of their work and then have a discussion on the topic/issue they’re presenting.</p>

  <p>Our goals for these events are to hear and share new ideas, challenge ourselves and others, and be able to leave the event with opportunities for ground-level action.</p>

                <td><p>Brooklyn Community Pride Center in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</em>, a two-hour, beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety. This workshop will cut through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put your campaign or advocacy efforts on solid ground with this introductory crash course in digital security from the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers. This full-day workshop highlights the most important information from many of our stand-alone digital security workshops in order to introduce participants to a wide selection of the most powerful and indispensable Free Software and Open Source tools for protecting their online privacy. Even if you began the day at square one, you will leave equipped with the same tools that militaries and private defense contractors use on a daily basis, and you’ll gain a fundamental understanding of how and why each tool works.</p>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s “CryptoJam” sampler offers an intensive, structured learning path through some of the most critical cybersecurity and online privacy considerations facing individuals and targeted activists today. From assessing your risk level through implementing operational security best practices, you will have the opportunity not only to install security tools, but to practice using key features that are too often overlooked.</p>

  <p>Featured tools and techniques covered include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Private messaging with Signal Private Messenger.</li>
    <li>First-party and trusted third-party Signal Safety Number verification techniques.</li>
    <li>Registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers (“burner” phones).</li>
    <li>Signal relay server IP address protection.</li>
    <li>Signal’s metadata-minimized Sealed Sender messages.</li>
    <li>Anonymous Web browsing with Tor and Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Using the Tor Browser’s Security Level slider.</li>
    <li>Using multiple Tor circuits in and outside of Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Accessing and self-hosting Onion services.</li>
    <li>Strengthening online account security using password and secrets management apps like KeePass, LastPass, and others.</li>
    <li>Basic Web and email phishing awareness training.</li>
    <li>Performing HTTPS (TLS) certificate checking.</li>
    <li>OpenPGP digital signature validation techniques in multiple environments such as Web mail (GMail) and dedicated apps (ProtonMail).</li>
    <li>and much more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s Radical Infrastructure CryptoJam is an excellent opportunity to learn a little bit about a lot, and to get a sense of what else you might want to learn. Since the workshop material is derived from our longer <a href="/workshops/">stand-alone workshops</a> and <a href="/courses/">intensive courses</a>, this full-day sampler is also a fantastic opportunity to get a sense of the Tech Learning Collective’s teaching style and a cursory overview of some of the material available at other Tech Learning Collective educational offerings.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

<p>We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.</p>

  <p>In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail">ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios</a>. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.</p>

  <p>This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/">freely available OpenPGP-compatible software</a>, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!</p>

                <td><p>Caveat in collaboration with The Tech Learning Collective presents <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!).</em> Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 10 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-01-18-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops.

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> is a free and open-source, worldwide mapping project that was started in 2004. Since
then, it has become a powerful, community-driven resource for people to share information about their immediate vicinity.</p>

  <p>Much more than simply a “Google Maps alternative,” OpenStreetMap (OSM) is also a freely-available dataset of geographic information that is collectively owned. It powers a huge assortment of public (and commercial!) services from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">weather monitoring stations</a>, <a href="https://openinframap.org/">civic infrastructure maps</a>, and even the map views from sites like Craigslist. An ever-evolving community of <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">humanitarians</a>, hobby cartographers, and neighborhood residents add, edit, and maintain the information in the OpenStreetMap database and, much like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute the things that are important to them simply by creating a free OpenStreetMap account.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, learn the basics of how to use this free tool to create and improve publicly available, communally editable maps of the things that matter to you. Learn about initiatives such as the <a href="https://tech-autonomy.com/maps#gender-neutral-restrooms">Tech Autonomist’s Gender-Neutral Restrooms map</a> which helps non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people find safe restrooms to use, along with other ways to find accessible venues, queer friendly spaces, and other necessary resources.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>

  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-03-15-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="/faq/#workshops-and-webinars">our workshops and webinars FAQ</a> for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop, open to all, is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective’s intensive <a href="/courses/web101.html">WEB101 course</a>, is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced “front-end designers” will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites really are and how they’re made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

                <td><p>TechAhoy in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work</em>. This two-hour workshop is all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens when you’re browsing a website, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective is excited to collaborate with <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a> in facilitating <em>Network the Revolution: Building Alternative Internets</em>. In this presentation/discussion group hybrid, we will briefly discuss the concept of alternative networking for the purpose of self-hosted, unsurveillable communications, the <a href="https://github.com/shiftctrlspace/library">digital library project as fronted by Shift-CTRL</a>, how Shift-CTRL uses Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to organize themselves, the process of de-/re-programming Capitalist rhetorics on digital technology, and whatever else should happen to spontaneously arise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our situation today is this: every time we use the Internet, we are forced to accept that we are using the surveillance engine of advanced Capitalism in the Necrocene, a corporate-supported machine that consumes everything in its sights for the purpose of re-packaging it as benign. Situated at the brink of total climate collapse, the disenfranchised continue to be given insipid promises that in the Automation Revolution, “learning to code” at a “bootcamp” will set them free.</p>

  <p>As Anarchists, we recognize the nature of this false promise from the quicksand on which it is based.</p>

  <p>Revolutionaries in the West have either forgotten, corrupted, or else have never had a chance to find out what it might be like to harness the efficacy of digital technology for the benefit of radical social movements; many have abandoned the idea that this is even worthwhile.</p>

  <p>But there has actually never been a better time to revisit this assumption: hardware has never been more superfluous and less expensive, with brand new, fully functional computers costing $35 and running Free and Open Source Software, and the prevalence of overlay networks like Tor eking further into the public conscious.</p>

  <p>There is no chance now of reclaiming the mainstream Internet in its entirety (and perhaps there never was such a chance). But there has never been more opportunity than right now to create new systems, new internets, informed by new perspectives and approached holistically, for the purposes of revolutionary praxis.</p>

  <p>Shift-CTRL, a radical queer semi-elusive hacklab based in New York City, has plunged headfirst into the margins of this electronic dreamland with vicious dedication to the ideal of better potentials for organizing radical spaces, and are peering out now to talk about its humble beginnings and the state of a new intranet connecting radical spaces in the City.</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

                <td><p>Join the Tech Learning Collective at the <a href="https://anarchistbookfair.net/">New York City Anarchist Bookfair</a> as we partner with the <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki">Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a> to present <em>Gone Phishing: Recognize Online Entrapment and Other Scams by Learning How to Launch Your Own Phishing Attack Website</em>. This workshop is a variation on <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">our “Gone Phishing” workshop</a> geared especially for activists and others who are targeted by well-resourced adversaries such as law enforcement organizations (LEOs), national intelligence agencies, and private security contractors.</p>

<p>We will be in the Judson Memorial Church’s Garden room at  3:30 PM to help you learn how to defend against phishing, the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if your online accounts are bulletproof, you can still get caught out by a “phishing” attack that steals your private data, like your username and password. In fact, from corporate espionage to police entrapment, most cyberattacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, many people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam. Today, one and a half million new phishing websites are launched every month. Some are dragnets, while others are “watering hole” or even “spear phishing” attacks designed to target a specific demographic or even one individual high-value target (HVT). Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>In this hands-on digital workshop presented in collaboration with the radical queer and femme Tech Learning Collective, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers including law enforcement officers (LEOs) build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

(Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!</p>

  <p>These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code></a> along with digital wiretapping tools like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.</p>

  <p>Join us for a two-hour mission: to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Radical Infrastructure: Your First Physical Server</em>, a full day intensive workshop that will get you up and running with your own server that you can administer from anywhere in the world. This one-day class combines material from several TLC courses (<a href="/courses/sys101.html">SYS101</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">NET101</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">SEC101</a>) into a single project-based exercise in which you will build, install, and configure your own server, from the ground up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the first step in effective radical organizing is often escaping from the surveillance economy by using alternatives to popular online services such as Google’s GMail for email and Facebook’s Messenger for instant messaging. However, simply jumping to another company’s equivalent product is like moving your money out of one too-big-to-fail bank into another; it’s a lateral move at best. Thankfully, it’s way easier to start (or find) organizations that run alternative digital infrastructures than it is to start a new bank.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, you’ll be guided through the first steps of setting up just such an alternative infrastructure capable of providing a plethora of digital services to hundreds or even thousands of people. Since every app you use ultimately relies on a physical computer somewhere in the world offering services, that’s where we’ll start: plugging a server into a power outlet. From there, we’ll install an Operating System, learn the basics of remote administration over SSH, and start choosing services to run on our new server. By starting at the ground level, you can see for yourself exactly how tools like Google Calendar or <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> actually work—and how easy they are to replicate for free on the scale of a community or neighborhood network.</p>

  <p>Moreover, one of the best-kept secrets in tech is that most off-the-shelf computers can function remarkably well as servers. For example, the Raspberry Pi is one great example of such a device that cash-strapped advocacy groups can use to astonishingly powerful ends if only they had the know-how. (A single Raspberry Pi device retails for $35 USD!) This means that most small- to mid-sized organizations of a dozen to several hundred people can have their own truly self-owned and self-operated server infrastructures, completely independent from the Googles and Facebooks of the world, for only a few dozen dollars.</p>

  <p>Whether you or your group is using messagers like WhatsApp, publishing blog posts with WordPress, or using other coordination tools like online maps, ultimately, you’re using someone’s computer. Do you know whose computer you’re using? Do you know where your servers are? Knowing exactly where your data lives is a critical step on the path towards true autonomy, and by the end of this workshop you’ll be well on your way to operating your own fleet of devices with which to replace your reliance on the corporate “cloud.”</p>

We will have some Raspberry Pi devices that you can practice with, but if you want to leave class with your own physical server that you can install in your home, venue, or organizing space, you will need to purchase a hardware device to keep. We recommend <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775">purchasing a Raspberry Pi from AdaFruit</a>, along with the required peripheral hardware to complete the project at home: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995">a power supply</a>, an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294">8GB or larger SD card (hard disk)</a>, an SD card reader/writer compatible with your laptop, a generic USB keyboard (and optionally a USB mouse), an HDMI video cable, and an HDMI-capable video monitor.</p>

<p>If you’re not ready or able to purchase a Raspberry Pi, <em>you can still participate with just your laptop</em> because we will also be covering how to create virtual machines in software to simulate real hardware. This technique makes it possible to start learning the fundamentals without needing to make any additional hardware purchases.

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for, “<em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>.” This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Each month, the crew at Team Human NYC hosts a guest to lead a conversation of shared interest that reflects the Team Human values. This month, they’ve invited the Tech Learning Collective to learn about <a href="/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html">our unique technology education pedagogy</a>.</p>

<p>From the Team Human NYC description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This month we’ll speak with two instructors from the Tech Learning Collective. The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.</p>

  <p>While politicians and federal bureaucracy lead reactive policy against big-tech, The Tech Learning Collective asks a more fundamental question: how can we engage with computer technology outside the realms of capitalism? Should digital literacy step beyond how to “use” or “sell” technology, and into how to “own” and “share?”</p>

  <p>We’ll use this time together to explore The Tech Learning Collective and put our minds together to find how each of us can contribute towards this purpose.</p>

  <p>Learn more about The Tech Learning Collective here: <a href="https://techlearningcollective.com/about/">https://techlearningcollective.com/about/</a></p>

  <p>We’ll start the event meeting and catching-up. Our guest will share some of their work and then have a discussion on the topic/issue they’re presenting.</p>

  <p>Our goals for these events are to hear and share new ideas, challenge ourselves and others, and be able to leave the event with opportunities for ground-level action.</p>

                <td><p>Brooklyn Community Pride Center in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</em>, a two-hour, beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety. This workshop will cut through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put your campaign or advocacy efforts on solid ground with this introductory crash course in digital security from the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers. This full-day workshop highlights the most important information from many of our stand-alone digital security workshops in order to introduce participants to a wide selection of the most powerful and indispensable Free Software and Open Source tools for protecting their online privacy. Even if you began the day at square one, you will leave equipped with the same tools that militaries and private defense contractors use on a daily basis, and you’ll gain a fundamental understanding of how and why each tool works.</p>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s “CryptoJam” sampler offers an intensive, structured learning path through some of the most critical cybersecurity and online privacy considerations facing individuals and targeted activists today. From assessing your risk level through implementing operational security best practices, you will have the opportunity not only to install security tools, but to practice using key features that are too often overlooked.</p>

  <p>Featured tools and techniques covered include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Private messaging with Signal Private Messenger.</li>
    <li>First-party and trusted third-party Signal Safety Number verification techniques.</li>
    <li>Registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers (“burner” phones).</li>
    <li>Signal relay server IP address protection.</li>
    <li>Signal’s metadata-minimized Sealed Sender messages.</li>
    <li>Anonymous Web browsing with Tor and Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Using the Tor Browser’s Security Level slider.</li>
    <li>Using multiple Tor circuits in and outside of Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Accessing and self-hosting Onion services.</li>
    <li>Strengthening online account security using password and secrets management apps like KeePass, LastPass, and others.</li>
    <li>Basic Web and email phishing awareness training.</li>
    <li>Performing HTTPS (TLS) certificate checking.</li>
    <li>OpenPGP digital signature validation techniques in multiple environments such as Web mail (GMail) and dedicated apps (ProtonMail).</li>
    <li>and much more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s Radical Infrastructure CryptoJam is an excellent opportunity to learn a little bit about a lot, and to get a sense of what else you might want to learn. Since the workshop material is derived from our longer <a href="/workshops/">stand-alone workshops</a> and <a href="/courses/">intensive courses</a>, this full-day sampler is also a fantastic opportunity to get a sense of the Tech Learning Collective’s teaching style and a cursory overview of some of the material available at other Tech Learning Collective educational offerings.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

<p>We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.</p>

  <p>In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail">ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios</a>. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.</p>

  <p>This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/">freely available OpenPGP-compatible software</a>, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!</p>

                <td><p>Caveat in collaboration with The Tech Learning Collective presents <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!).</em> Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 10 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-01-18-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> is a free and open-source, worldwide mapping project that was started in 2004. Since
then, it has become a powerful, community-driven resource for people to share information about their immediate vicinity.</p>

  <p>Much more than simply a “Google Maps alternative,” OpenStreetMap (OSM) is also a freely-available dataset of geographic information that is collectively owned. It powers a huge assortment of public (and commercial!) services from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">weather monitoring stations</a>, <a href="https://openinframap.org/">civic infrastructure maps</a>, and even the map views from sites like Craigslist. An ever-evolving community of <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">humanitarians</a>, hobby cartographers, and neighborhood residents add, edit, and maintain the information in the OpenStreetMap database and, much like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute the things that are important to them simply by creating a free OpenStreetMap account.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, learn the basics of how to use this free tool to create and improve publicly available, communally editable maps of the things that matter to you. Learn about initiatives such as the <a href="https://tech-autonomy.com/maps#gender-neutral-restrooms">Tech Autonomist’s Gender-Neutral Restrooms map</a> which helps non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people find safe restrooms to use, along with other ways to find accessible venues, queer friendly spaces, and other necessary resources.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>

  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-03-15-tor-what-is-it-good-for-absolutely-everything">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop, open to all, is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>PowrPlnt in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Introduction to Writing Your Own Website in HTML and CSS</em>. This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective’s intensive <a href="/courses/web101.html">WEB101 course</a>, is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced “front-end designers” will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites really are and how they’re made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

                <td><p>TechAhoy in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work</em>. This two-hour workshop is all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens when you’re browsing a website, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

(Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective is excited to collaborate with <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a> in facilitating <em>Network the Revolution: Building Alternative Internets</em>. In this presentation/discussion group hybrid, we will briefly discuss the concept of alternative networking for the purpose of self-hosted, unsurveillable communications, the <a href="https://github.com/shiftctrlspace/library">digital library project as fronted by Shift-CTRL</a>, how Shift-CTRL uses Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to organize themselves, the process of de-/re-programming Capitalist rhetorics on digital technology, and whatever else should happen to spontaneously arise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our situation today is this: every time we use the Internet, we are forced to accept that we are using the surveillance engine of advanced Capitalism in the Necrocene, a corporate-supported machine that consumes everything in its sights for the purpose of re-packaging it as benign. Situated at the brink of total climate collapse, the disenfranchised continue to be given insipid promises that in the Automation Revolution, “learning to code” at a “bootcamp” will set them free.</p>

  <p>As Anarchists, we recognize the nature of this false promise from the quicksand on which it is based.</p>

  <p>Revolutionaries in the West have either forgotten, corrupted, or else have never had a chance to find out what it might be like to harness the efficacy of digital technology for the benefit of radical social movements; many have abandoned the idea that this is even worthwhile.</p>

  <p>But there has actually never been a better time to revisit this assumption: hardware has never been more superfluous and less expensive, with brand new, fully functional computers costing $35 and running Free and Open Source Software, and the prevalence of overlay networks like Tor eking further into the public conscious.</p>

  <p>There is no chance now of reclaiming the mainstream Internet in its entirety (and perhaps there never was such a chance). But there has never been more opportunity than right now to create new systems, new internets, informed by new perspectives and approached holistically, for the purposes of revolutionary praxis.</p>

  <p>Shift-CTRL, a radical queer semi-elusive hacklab based in New York City, has plunged headfirst into the margins of this electronic dreamland with vicious dedication to the ideal of better potentials for organizing radical spaces, and are peering out now to talk about its humble beginnings and the state of a new intranet connecting radical spaces in the City.</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

                <td><p>Join the Tech Learning Collective at the <a href="https://anarchistbookfair.net/">New York City Anarchist Bookfair</a> as we partner with the <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki">Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a> to present <em>Gone Phishing: Recognize Online Entrapment and Other Scams by Learning How to Launch Your Own Phishing Attack Website</em>. This workshop is a variation on <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">our “Gone Phishing” workshop</a> geared especially for activists and others who are targeted by well-resourced adversaries such as law enforcement organizations (LEOs), national intelligence agencies, and private security contractors.</p>

<p>We will be in the Judson Memorial Church’s Garden room at  3:30 PM to help you learn how to defend against phishing, the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if your online accounts are bulletproof, you can still get caught out by a “phishing” attack that steals your private data, like your username and password. In fact, from corporate espionage to police entrapment, most cyberattacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, many people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam. Today, one and a half million new phishing websites are launched every month. Some are dragnets, while others are “watering hole” or even “spear phishing” attacks designed to target a specific demographic or even one individual high-value target (HVT). Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>In this hands-on digital workshop presented in collaboration with the radical queer and femme Tech Learning Collective, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers including law enforcement officers (LEOs) build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Interference Archive in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!</p>

  <p>These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code></a> along with digital wiretapping tools like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.</p>

  <p>Join us for a two-hour mission: to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Radical Infrastructure: Your First Physical Server</em>, a full day intensive workshop that will get you up and running with your own server that you can administer from anywhere in the world. This one-day class combines material from several TLC courses (<a href="/courses/sys101.html">SYS101</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">NET101</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">SEC101</a>) into a single project-based exercise in which you will build, install, and configure your own server, from the ground up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the first step in effective radical organizing is often escaping from the surveillance economy by using alternatives to popular online services such as Google’s GMail for email and Facebook’s Messenger for instant messaging. However, simply jumping to another company’s equivalent product is like moving your money out of one too-big-to-fail bank into another; it’s a lateral move at best. Thankfully, it’s way easier to start (or find) organizations that run alternative digital infrastructures than it is to start a new bank.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, you’ll be guided through the first steps of setting up just such an alternative infrastructure capable of providing a plethora of digital services to hundreds or even thousands of people. Since every app you use ultimately relies on a physical computer somewhere in the world offering services, that’s where we’ll start: plugging a server into a power outlet. From there, we’ll install an Operating System, learn the basics of remote administration over SSH, and start choosing services to run on our new server. By starting at the ground level, you can see for yourself exactly how tools like Google Calendar or <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> actually work—and how easy they are to replicate for free on the scale of a community or neighborhood network.</p>

  <p>Moreover, one of the best-kept secrets in tech is that most off-the-shelf computers can function remarkably well as servers. For example, the Raspberry Pi is one great example of such a device that cash-strapped advocacy groups can use to astonishingly powerful ends if only they had the know-how. (A single Raspberry Pi device retails for $35 USD!) This means that most small- to mid-sized organizations of a dozen to several hundred people can have their own truly self-owned and self-operated server infrastructures, completely independent from the Googles and Facebooks of the world, for only a few dozen dollars.</p>

  <p>Whether you or your group is using messagers like WhatsApp, publishing blog posts with WordPress, or using other coordination tools like online maps, ultimately, you’re using someone’s computer. Do you know whose computer you’re using? Do you know where your servers are? Knowing exactly where your data lives is a critical step on the path towards true autonomy, and by the end of this workshop you’ll be well on your way to operating your own fleet of devices with which to replace your reliance on the corporate “cloud.”</p>

<p><strong>Tickets</strong> are sold on a first-come, first-served basis and are only available via <a href="https://www.artful.ly/store/events/18622">our online storefront</a>.

We will have some Raspberry Pi devices that you can practice with, but if you want to leave class with your own physical server that you can install in your home, venue, or organizing space, you will need to purchase a hardware device to keep. We recommend <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775">purchasing a Raspberry Pi from AdaFruit</a>, along with the required peripheral hardware to complete the project at home: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995">a power supply</a>, an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294">8GB or larger SD card (hard disk)</a>, an SD card reader/writer compatible with your laptop, a generic USB keyboard (and optionally a USB mouse), an HDMI video cable, and an HDMI-capable video monitor.</p>

<p>If you’re not ready or able to purchase a Raspberry Pi, <em>you can still participate with just your laptop</em> because we will also be covering how to create virtual machines in software to simulate real hardware. This technique makes it possible to start learning the fundamentals without needing to make any additional hardware purchases.

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for, “<em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>.” This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Each month, the crew at Team Human NYC hosts a guest to lead a conversation of shared interest that reflects the Team Human values. This month, they’ve invited the Tech Learning Collective to learn about <a href="/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html">our unique technology education pedagogy</a>.</p>

<p>From the Team Human NYC description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This month we’ll speak with two instructors from the Tech Learning Collective. The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.</p>

  <p>While politicians and federal bureaucracy lead reactive policy against big-tech, The Tech Learning Collective asks a more fundamental question: how can we engage with computer technology outside the realms of capitalism? Should digital literacy step beyond how to “use” or “sell” technology, and into how to “own” and “share?”</p>

  <p>We’ll use this time together to explore The Tech Learning Collective and put our minds together to find how each of us can contribute towards this purpose.</p>

  <p>Learn more about The Tech Learning Collective here: <a href="https://techlearningcollective.com/about/">https://techlearningcollective.com/about/</a></p>

  <p>We’ll start the event meeting and catching-up. Our guest will share some of their work and then have a discussion on the topic/issue they’re presenting.</p>

  <p>Our goals for these events are to hear and share new ideas, challenge ourselves and others, and be able to leave the event with opportunities for ground-level action.</p>

                <td><p>Brooklyn Community Pride Center in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</em>, a two-hour, beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety. This workshop will cut through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put your campaign or advocacy efforts on solid ground with this introductory crash course in digital security from the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers. This full-day workshop highlights the most important information from many of our stand-alone digital security workshops in order to introduce participants to a wide selection of the most powerful and indispensable Free Software and Open Source tools for protecting their online privacy. Even if you began the day at square one, you will leave equipped with the same tools that militaries and private defense contractors use on a daily basis, and you’ll gain a fundamental understanding of how and why each tool works.</p>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s “CryptoJam” sampler offers an intensive, structured learning path through some of the most critical cybersecurity and online privacy considerations facing individuals and targeted activists today. From assessing your risk level through implementing operational security best practices, you will have the opportunity not only to install security tools, but to practice using key features that are too often overlooked.</p>

  <p>Featured tools and techniques covered include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Private messaging with Signal Private Messenger.</li>
    <li>First-party and trusted third-party Signal Safety Number verification techniques.</li>
    <li>Registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers (“burner” phones).</li>
    <li>Signal relay server IP address protection.</li>
    <li>Signal’s metadata-minimized Sealed Sender messages.</li>
    <li>Anonymous Web browsing with Tor and Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Using the Tor Browser’s Security Level slider.</li>
    <li>Using multiple Tor circuits in and outside of Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Accessing and self-hosting Onion services.</li>
    <li>Strengthening online account security using password and secrets management apps like KeePass, LastPass, and others.</li>
    <li>Basic Web and email phishing awareness training.</li>
    <li>Performing HTTPS (TLS) certificate checking.</li>
    <li>OpenPGP digital signature validation techniques in multiple environments such as Web mail (GMail) and dedicated apps (ProtonMail).</li>
    <li>and much more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s Radical Infrastructure CryptoJam is an excellent opportunity to learn a little bit about a lot, and to get a sense of what else you might want to learn. Since the workshop material is derived from our longer <a href="/workshops/">stand-alone workshops</a> and <a href="/courses/">intensive courses</a>, this full-day sampler is also a fantastic opportunity to get a sense of the Tech Learning Collective’s teaching style and a cursory overview of some of the material available at other Tech Learning Collective educational offerings.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

<h2 id="about-shift-ctrl-space">About <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a></h2>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

<h2 id="about-livecodenyc">About <a href="https://livecode.nyc/">LiveCode.NYC</a></h2>

<p>We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tickets</strong> to this workshop are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and are only available in advance via <a href="https://www.artful.ly/store/events/19035">our online storefront</a>.

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.</p>

  <p>In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail">ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios</a>. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.</p>

  <p>This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/">freely available OpenPGP-compatible software</a>, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Class space is limited to 15 students! Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes early to reserve your seat and purchase your ticket.</p>

<p>You do not need to bring a laptop to class, but may want to do so to follow along with the exercises.</p>

<p>As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior <em>will</em> result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

                <td><p>Caveat in collaboration with The Tech Learning Collective presents <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!).</em> Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 10 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-01-18-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> is a free and open-source, worldwide mapping project that was started in 2004. Since
then, it has become a powerful, community-driven resource for people to share information about their immediate vicinity.</p>

  <p>Much more than simply a “Google Maps alternative,” OpenStreetMap (OSM) is also a freely-available dataset of geographic information that is collectively owned. It powers a huge assortment of public (and commercial!) services from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">weather monitoring stations</a>, <a href="https://openinframap.org/">civic infrastructure maps</a>, and even the map views from sites like Craigslist. An ever-evolving community of <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">humanitarians</a>, hobby cartographers, and neighborhood residents add, edit, and maintain the information in the OpenStreetMap database and, much like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute the things that are important to them simply by creating a free OpenStreetMap account.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, learn the basics of how to use this free tool to create and improve publicly available, communally editable maps of the things that matter to you. Learn about initiatives such as the <a href="https://tech-autonomy.com/maps#gender-neutral-restrooms">Tech Autonomist’s Gender-Neutral Restrooms map</a> which helps non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people find safe restrooms to use, along with other ways to find accessible venues, queer friendly spaces, and other necessary resources.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>

  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>Wonderville NYC in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop, open to all, is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective’s intensive <a href="/courses/web101.html">WEB101 course</a>, is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced “front-end designers” will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites really are and how they’re made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

                <td><p>TechAhoy in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>. This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Clearing Away the Clouds: How Computer Networks, Servers, and the Internet Work</em>. This two-hour workshop is all about the basics of computer networking. If you’ve ever been curious about what happens when you’re browsing a website, or if you ever wanted to take a look “under the hood” of your Wi-Fi connection, this is the class for you!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

(Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective is excited to collaborate with <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a> in facilitating <em>Network the Revolution: Building Alternative Internets</em>. In this presentation/discussion group hybrid, we will briefly discuss the concept of alternative networking for the purpose of self-hosted, unsurveillable communications, the <a href="https://github.com/shiftctrlspace/library">digital library project as fronted by Shift-CTRL</a>, how Shift-CTRL uses Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to organize themselves, the process of de-/re-programming Capitalist rhetorics on digital technology, and whatever else should happen to spontaneously arise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our situation today is this: every time we use the Internet, we are forced to accept that we are using the surveillance engine of advanced Capitalism in the Necrocene, a corporate-supported machine that consumes everything in its sights for the purpose of re-packaging it as benign. Situated at the brink of total climate collapse, the disenfranchised continue to be given insipid promises that in the Automation Revolution, “learning to code” at a “bootcamp” will set them free.</p>

  <p>As Anarchists, we recognize the nature of this false promise from the quicksand on which it is based.</p>

  <p>Revolutionaries in the West have either forgotten, corrupted, or else have never had a chance to find out what it might be like to harness the efficacy of digital technology for the benefit of radical social movements; many have abandoned the idea that this is even worthwhile.</p>

  <p>But there has actually never been a better time to revisit this assumption: hardware has never been more superfluous and less expensive, with brand new, fully functional computers costing $35 and running Free and Open Source Software, and the prevalence of overlay networks like Tor eking further into the public conscious.</p>

  <p>There is no chance now of reclaiming the mainstream Internet in its entirety (and perhaps there never was such a chance). But there has never been more opportunity than right now to create new systems, new internets, informed by new perspectives and approached holistically, for the purposes of revolutionary praxis.</p>

  <p>Shift-CTRL, a radical queer semi-elusive hacklab based in New York City, has plunged headfirst into the margins of this electronic dreamland with vicious dedication to the ideal of better potentials for organizing radical spaces, and are peering out now to talk about its humble beginnings and the state of a new intranet connecting radical spaces in the City.</p>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

                <td><p>Join the Tech Learning Collective at the <a href="https://anarchistbookfair.net/">New York City Anarchist Bookfair</a> as we partner with the <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki">Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a> to present <em>Gone Phishing: Recognize Online Entrapment and Other Scams by Learning How to Launch Your Own Phishing Attack Website</em>. This workshop is a variation on <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">our “Gone Phishing” workshop</a> geared especially for activists and others who are targeted by well-resourced adversaries such as law enforcement organizations (LEOs), national intelligence agencies, and private security contractors.</p>

<p>We will be in the Judson Memorial Church’s Garden room at  3:30 PM to help you learn how to defend against phishing, the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if your online accounts are bulletproof, you can still get caught out by a “phishing” attack that steals your private data, like your username and password. In fact, from corporate espionage to police entrapment, most cyberattacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, many people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam. Today, one and a half million new phishing websites are launched every month. Some are dragnets, while others are “watering hole” or even “spear phishing” attacks designed to target a specific demographic or even one individual high-value target (HVT). Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>In this hands-on digital workshop presented in collaboration with the radical queer and femme Tech Learning Collective, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers including law enforcement officers (LEOs) build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Interference Archive in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what’s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we’ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us—or not!</p>

  <p>These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments—our messages—as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they’ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they’ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as <a href="https://nmap.org/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code></a> along with digital wiretapping tools like <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.</p>

  <p>Join us for a two-hour mission: to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Radical Infrastructure: Your First Physical Server</em>, a full day intensive workshop that will get you up and running with your own server that you can administer from anywhere in the world. This one-day class combines material from several TLC courses (<a href="/courses/sys101.html">SYS101</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">NET101</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">SEC101</a>) into a single project-based exercise in which you will build, install, and configure your own server, from the ground up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, the first step in effective radical organizing is often escaping from the surveillance economy by using alternatives to popular online services such as Google’s GMail for email and Facebook’s Messenger for instant messaging. However, simply jumping to another company’s equivalent product is like moving your money out of one too-big-to-fail bank into another; it’s a lateral move at best. Thankfully, it’s way easier to start (or find) organizations that run alternative digital infrastructures than it is to start a new bank.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, you’ll be guided through the first steps of setting up just such an alternative infrastructure capable of providing a plethora of digital services to hundreds or even thousands of people. Since every app you use ultimately relies on a physical computer somewhere in the world offering services, that’s where we’ll start: plugging a server into a power outlet. From there, we’ll install an Operating System, learn the basics of remote administration over SSH, and start choosing services to run on our new server. By starting at the ground level, you can see for yourself exactly how tools like Google Calendar or <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> actually work—and how easy they are to replicate for free on the scale of a community or neighborhood network.</p>

  <p>Moreover, one of the best-kept secrets in tech is that most off-the-shelf computers can function remarkably well as servers. For example, the Raspberry Pi is one great example of such a device that cash-strapped advocacy groups can use to astonishingly powerful ends if only they had the know-how. (A single Raspberry Pi device retails for $35 USD!) This means that most small- to mid-sized organizations of a dozen to several hundred people can have their own truly self-owned and self-operated server infrastructures, completely independent from the Googles and Facebooks of the world, for only a few dozen dollars.</p>

  <p>Whether you or your group is using messagers like WhatsApp, publishing blog posts with WordPress, or using other coordination tools like online maps, ultimately, you’re using someone’s computer. Do you know whose computer you’re using? Do you know where your servers are? Knowing exactly where your data lives is a critical step on the path towards true autonomy, and by the end of this workshop you’ll be well on your way to operating your own fleet of devices with which to replace your reliance on the corporate “cloud.”</p>

We will have some Raspberry Pi devices that you can practice with, but if you want to leave class with your own physical server that you can install in your home, venue, or organizing space, you will need to purchase a hardware device to keep. We recommend <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775">purchasing a Raspberry Pi from AdaFruit</a>, along with the required peripheral hardware to complete the project at home: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995">a power supply</a>, an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294">8GB or larger SD card (hard disk)</a>, an SD card reader/writer compatible with your laptop, a generic USB keyboard (and optionally a USB mouse), an HDMI video cable, and an HDMI-capable video monitor.</p>

<p>If you’re not ready or able to purchase a Raspberry Pi, <em>you can still participate with just your laptop</em> because we will also be covering how to create virtual machines in software to simulate real hardware. This technique makes it possible to start learning the fundamentals without needing to make any additional hardware purchases.

                <td><p>TechAhoy in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Open Doors: Introduction to the Art of Lockpicking</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for, “<em>Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams</em>.” This workshop is a combination “attack/defense” exercise focusing on Web-based social engineering attacks. Participants will practice both how to launch their own attacks as well as how to defend against them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam</a>, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

                <td><p>Each month, the crew at Team Human NYC hosts a guest to lead a conversation of shared interest that reflects the Team Human values. This month, they’ve invited the Tech Learning Collective to learn about <a href="/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html">our unique technology education pedagogy</a>.</p>

<p>From the Team Human NYC description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This month we’ll speak with two instructors from the Tech Learning Collective. The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.</p>

  <p>While politicians and federal bureaucracy lead reactive policy against big-tech, The Tech Learning Collective asks a more fundamental question: how can we engage with computer technology outside the realms of capitalism? Should digital literacy step beyond how to “use” or “sell” technology, and into how to “own” and “share?”</p>

  <p>We’ll use this time together to explore The Tech Learning Collective and put our minds together to find how each of us can contribute towards this purpose.</p>

  <p>Learn more about The Tech Learning Collective here: <a href="https://techlearningcollective.com/about/">https://techlearningcollective.com/about/</a></p>

  <p>We’ll start the event meeting and catching-up. Our guest will share some of their work and then have a discussion on the topic/issue they’re presenting.</p>

  <p>Our goals for these events are to hear and share new ideas, challenge ourselves and others, and be able to leave the event with opportunities for ground-level action.</p>

                <td><p>Brooklyn Community Pride Center in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: <em>Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</em>, a two-hour, beginner-friendly introduction to digital safety. This workshop will cut through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle, and offer an opportunity to ask the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers your most pressing online privacy and digital security questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

                <td><p>The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for <em>Tor: What is it Good For? (Absolutely Everything!)</em>, a two-hour mini-intensive digital safety workshop focused on the Tor Project. Tor is a free, state-of-the-art, privacy-enhancing Web browser, SOCKS proxy, and anonymizing overlay mixnet. Don’t worry if you don’t know what these terms mean, that’s what the workshop is for!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put your campaign or advocacy efforts on solid ground with this introductory crash course in digital security from the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers. This full-day workshop highlights the most important information from many of our stand-alone digital security workshops in order to introduce participants to a wide selection of the most powerful and indispensable Free Software and Open Source tools for protecting their online privacy. Even if you began the day at square one, you will leave equipped with the same tools that militaries and private defense contractors use on a daily basis, and you’ll gain a fundamental understanding of how and why each tool works.</p>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s “CryptoJam” sampler offers an intensive, structured learning path through some of the most critical cybersecurity and online privacy considerations facing individuals and targeted activists today. From assessing your risk level through implementing operational security best practices, you will have the opportunity not only to install security tools, but to practice using key features that are too often overlooked.</p>

  <p>Featured tools and techniques covered include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Private messaging with Signal Private Messenger.</li>
    <li>First-party and trusted third-party Signal Safety Number verification techniques.</li>
    <li>Registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers (“burner” phones).</li>
    <li>Signal relay server IP address protection.</li>
    <li>Signal’s metadata-minimized Sealed Sender messages.</li>
    <li>Anonymous Web browsing with Tor and Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Using the Tor Browser’s Security Level slider.</li>
    <li>Using multiple Tor circuits in and outside of Tor Browser.</li>
    <li>Accessing and self-hosting Onion services.</li>
    <li>Strengthening online account security using password and secrets management apps like KeePass, LastPass, and others.</li>
    <li>Basic Web and email phishing awareness training.</li>
    <li>Performing HTTPS (TLS) certificate checking.</li>
    <li>OpenPGP digital signature validation techniques in multiple environments such as Web mail (GMail) and dedicated apps (ProtonMail).</li>
    <li>and much more!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Tech Learning Collective’s Radical Infrastructure CryptoJam is an excellent opportunity to learn a little bit about a lot, and to get a sense of what else you might want to learn. Since the workshop material is derived from our longer <a href="/workshops/">stand-alone workshops</a> and <a href="/courses/">intensive courses</a>, this full-day sampler is also a fantastic opportunity to get a sense of the Tech Learning Collective’s teaching style and a cursory overview of some of the material available at other Tech Learning Collective educational offerings.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

                <td><p>Part movie night, part cybersecurity workshop, join the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers as they take you on a guided tour of Hollywood’s most memorable, fantastical, and even kind of realistic hacking scenes to ever grace the silver screen. From WarGames (1983), to Hackers (1995), to The Matrix Reloaded (2003), and many more, revisit all your favorite hacker movie moments augmented with edutaining commentary from a peanut gallery of cybersecurity instructors!</p>

<p>We’ll watch a clip from the movie, then critique it from a technopolitical perspective. In the process, you’ll be exposed to some indinspensible computer security tools (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code>!), learn about hacking exploits of yesteryear, and ultimately gain a better sense of how to separate fiction from reality in contemporary hacking dramas in pop culture.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>To most people, locks often symbolize permanence, safety, or ownership, and they can serve critical social functions, such as demarcating public space from private space. Like all other technologies, locks can be used for good or evil ends, making them inherently political. Powerful people use locks to hoard resources and create obstacles or barriers for the less resourced, but locks can also be used as legitimate security devices to slow the advance of a theif, sabateur, or other ill-intentioned actor.</p>

  <p>To a locksmith or lock picker, a lock can be as profound as an intense intellectual exercise or as mundane as another set of fantastic fidget toys. Picking a lock is the classic analog equivalent to hacking. It can be both fun and surprisingly meditative!</p>

  <p>In this hands-on introduction to physical security, learn to pick your first lock, or hone your understanding of how traditional American pin and tumbler locks work. Find out just how easy it is to pick most typical padlocks, and discover what really makes locks click. We’ll go over the basics of fundamental picking techniques such as single-pin picking (SPP) and raking, so you can understand why they’re effective, along with basic shim technique for combination and other keyless locks.</p>

  <p>Practice picks and locks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own if you’re comfortable sharing. We guarantee that opening your first lock—without the key—will fundamentally change the way you see the world!</p>

<h2 id="about-shift-ctrl-space">About <a href="https://shiftctrl.space/">Shift-CTRL Space</a></h2>

<p>We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.</p>

<h2 id="about-livecodenyc">About <a href="https://livecode.nyc/">LiveCode.NYC</a></h2>

<p>We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h3 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>As one of the oldest digital communication methods, email is used for everything from pointless chain letters to critical financial statements and legal actions. The name “e-mail” might make you think that electronic mail works the same way that writing a physical letter does, but this isn’t entirely true. From a technical perspective, it’s more like “e-postcards” because, just like sending a postcard through the postal service, anyone who handles your postcard can read what you wrote.</p>

  <p>In the physical world, protecting your correspondence requires you to take the extra step of putting your letter inside an envelope and then sealing the envelope. That way, no one looking at the outside of the envelope can read what you wrote on the letter paper. To protect your email in the digital world, you still have to take this extra step of putting your letter inside a metaphorical envelope. Some services, like <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/ProtonMail">ProtonMail, claim to do this for you, but fail to do so in many common scenarios</a>. Meanwhile, many people believe that just using Google’s GMail service means all your email content is always readable by Google, but this isn’t always true either.</p>

  <p>This workshop will demystify the nuance of email privacy and security. By using <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/protocols/gpg/">freely available OpenPGP-compatible software</a>, which has been available since 1991, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity instructors will show you how you can keep your message contents private regardless of the email service provider you use. Never send paperwork with your social security number or other sensitive details on a digital postcard to your lawyer or accountant ever again!</p>

<p>Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Class space is limited to 15 students! Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes early to reserve your seat and purchase your ticket.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on <a href="https://torproject.org/">Tor</a>, the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 10 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-01-18-digital-defenses-for-the-people-practical-digital-security">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance.

By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>As most of us know first-hand, the creative process involves many edits and revisions. Adding a little bit here, trimming a little bit there, but then hitting “undo” a bunch and experimenting with a new direction is quite normal! When your project is a single file, pressing “Save As…” many times might suffice, but what if your project spans dozens or even hundreds of files?</p>

  <p>This is where version control systems (VCSs) shine. Designed to track, compare, and merge different versions of the same project, these tools give you the ability to make a snapshot of the state of your work at a given point in time so that you can “undo” or “redo” any number of times, across any number of files. Moreover, by naming different snapshots, you can create an infinite number of variations of your project and then build on those unique versions without affecting the others; it’s as though the new version is in its own alternate universe. This makes it possible to easily and safely experiment in one universe (called a <em>branch</em>) without throwing away or overwriting the original version of the project on which your changes were based.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn the basics of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a free distributed version control system on which popular sites like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are based. Git is lovingly called “the stupid content tracker” because it can track changes to everything and anything that can be digitized. Although it was originally invented for software programmers, Git is also useful for novelists, researchers, and anyone else whose work involves creativity in a digital medium.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our ability to browse Web sites, send and receive digital messages like emails and text messages, and make phone or video calls depends on the connections our digital devices make with one another. That makes it critical to understand how these connections are made, and where they lead to. Far from being an amorphous “cloud,” modern telecommunications networks and services like the Internet are made up of physical devices. Some of these you can see, like your own computer or the router and modem in your house, and others you can’t, like distant servers or Layer 2 switches that make up the network infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>In this workshop derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/net101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s NET101 course</a>, you’ll have the opportunity to actually look—visually and with great detail—at how your computer “talks” to other computers like those that power Google Drive, Facebook, and other cloud services. By using an industry-standard tool called <a href="https://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, we’ll dissect a conversation between your computer and a server and walk through the process of encapsulating a packet of application layer data, emitting it onto a network, and watching it travel to its destination. We’ll also touch on some illustrative counter-examples to explore how things can go wrong on a network, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a> server misconfigurations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP spoofing attacks</a>, and unsecured or weakly-secured Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning how to stay safe online is on many people’s minds, but how do you start this process? With so many tools and suggestions from “experts,” how do you know which tool to use, when, and in what situation? Do you really need a VPN? (And what even is that?) What are the tools you really <em>should</em> use, and which tools aren’t worth it? Moreover, without being a cybersecurity expert yourself, how do you learn to sniff out the useful stuff from the placebos?</p>

  <p>This beginner’s workshop taught by the <a href="/">Tech Learning Collective</a>’s cybersecurity trainers offers <a href="/about/persona-matrix/">a simple framework</a> anyone can use to understand what risks they might face and how to protect themselves from those risks. <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Persona-based-training-matrix">Developed and maintained by the Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective</a>, an independent cybersecurity research group that provides digital security services to anti-fascist groups in New York City, this framework now forms the basis of many digital safety workshops. It is a simple three-by-three grid in which you can place both yourself and your online safety concerns by answering a few intuitive questions like “How likely is it that I will be targeted?” and “How many resources (money, people, etcetera) does my attacker have?”</p>

  <p>Although <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/">there are many good and free tools available</a>, most people only need to use a few basic ones: a secure messaging application (like <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>), a password manager (like <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> or <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), and a few of the built-in features of their existing computers, like the full-disk encryption software available for free on every modern laptop and smartphone. This short, calming introduction to digital safety cuts through the fear, uncertainty, and doubt generated by the frenetic news cycle and the latest Internet privacy listicle. You’ll leave this workshop with a security plan in place, and a much clearer picture of the first few steps you <em>should</em> take to protect yourself and your information both online and offline.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> is a free and open-source, worldwide mapping project that was started in 2004. Since
then, it has become a powerful, community-driven resource for people to share information about their immediate vicinity.</p>

  <p>Much more than simply a “Google Maps alternative,” OpenStreetMap (OSM) is also a freely-available dataset of geographic information that is collectively owned. It powers a huge assortment of public (and commercial!) services from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">weather monitoring stations</a>, <a href="https://openinframap.org/">civic infrastructure maps</a>, and even the map views from sites like Craigslist. An ever-evolving community of <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">humanitarians</a>, hobby cartographers, and neighborhood residents add, edit, and maintain the information in the OpenStreetMap database and, much like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute the things that are important to them simply by creating a free OpenStreetMap account.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, learn the basics of how to use this free tool to create and improve publicly available, communally editable maps of the things that matter to you. Learn about initiatives such as the <a href="https://tech-autonomy.com/maps#gender-neutral-restrooms">Tech Autonomist’s Gender-Neutral Restrooms map</a> which helps non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming people find safe restrooms to use, along with other ways to find accessible venues, queer friendly spaces, and other necessary resources.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you’re an individual chatting with friends or an organizer planning a political action, all effective coordination depends on safe and reliable communication. Lacking integrity for our communications dooms any effort from the outset, whether mundane or revolutionary. As dragnet surveillance practices are legalized at alarming speed and continue to be fueled by a dramatic expansion of the law enforcement and private defense contractor economies, there has never been a more important time to flex your digital civil liberties muscle than right now.</p>

  <p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the name of a Free Software, secure, private message application built on a cryptographic protocol of the same name. Formerly known as the Axolotl Ratchet or, more commonly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double-Ratchet Algorithm</a>, its features are robust enough for the revolutionary activist (i.e., end-to-end encryption, message authentication, plausible deniability or message repudiation, perfect forward secrecy, and more) and yet simple enough to use as a drop-in replacement for your existing text messaging application. Signal also sports Skype-like voice and video calling, location- and file-sharing features, and even iMessage-style large font emojis!</p>

  <p>If you’ve never heard of Signal before, now’s the time to switch. If you think you already know how to use Signal, let us show you some pro-tips (trusted third-party Safety Number verification, disappearing messages, registering Signal accounts with pseudonymous phone numbers, inactivity lock-outs, and Signal relay server IP address protection). This introductory cybersecurity workshop will show you why Signal is simple enough to schedule drinks at the bar with, yet secure enough to use for planning a protest.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

  <p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every app you use—from messengers like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> or WhatsApp to blogs and websites like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and even other coordination tools like digital calendars and <a href="/workshops/Our-Streets,-Our-Maps-Introduction-to-OpenStreetMap">online maps</a>—relies on a computer called a server. Whether that computer is one in your hand (your smartphone), or a computer somewhere across the Internet (“in the cloud”), no meaningful digital communication happens without servers offering services, somewhere. So, do you know where <em>your</em> servers are? If not, you can’t know how safe your data is!</p>

  <p>When you don’t have a clear map of how your messages and other data gets from here to there, you might be at risk of someone listening in on your conversations. When you rely on services that you don’t own yourself for critical day-to-day operations (like Google Calendar, or Facebook…) you risk losing access to those capabilities by having your account banned, even by mistake. Regardless of your specific situation, knowing more about the digital servers that are serving you is a vital first step for supporting communities or companies large and small.</p>

  <p>This intermediate-level workshop combines various topics from the <a href="/courses/sys101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s System Administration</a>, <a href="/courses/net101.html">Networking</a>, and <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Security</a> courses to offer an intensive crash course in secure server setup, monitoring, and maintenance. By taking a <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/blob/master/train-the-trainers/practice-labs/introduction-to-securing-virtualized-secure-shell-servers/README.md">deep dive into the SSH protocol</a>, you’ll learn how to set up remote administrative access to a server in a safe way, and you’ll be exposed to the potential risks of network eavesdroppers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks</a>, and much more. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a basic understanding of how to safely operate self-hosted digital infrastructures for yourself, your friends, and your comrades, as well as what first steps you need to take to keep intruders and enemies at bay.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much good does a powerful tool do for you if you don’t know how to use it well? How much more capable would you be if you mastered all the tools available to you? It might sound ridiculous, but failing to learn the practicalities of computer system operation basics is arguably the most common mistake people in the fast-paced tech scene make.</p>

  <p>Modern computers are power tools, and behind each one of them is a human operator, or “system administrator,” responsible for configuring and maintaining that computer. If you have a personal computer such as a laptop or smartphone, then you are already a system administrator whether you realize it or not! Making sure the apps you want to use are installed and up to date, managing the amount of free space you have for your photos, and connecting or disconnecting from the Internet are all examples of simple system administration tasks that you probably already take on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, we’ll start by exploring what happens inside your computer when you take every-day tasks like open a Web browser or save files, and then dive down the rabbit hole to meet the special class of programs that make it possible for all your other programs to work. Called <em>daemons</em>, short for Disk Access and Execution Monitors, they make up the world of Operating System services, signals, sockets, and more under the hood of your desktop environment. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a far deeper understanding of how to care for your computer, as well as the ability to understand any new tools or services you encounter a whole lot faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be useful, every computer must offer some way for you to control it. Generically, the way you can control a computer is called a <em>user interface</em> because it allows you (the user) to interact with (that is, “to interface with”) the computer system. Most people may already be familiar with <em>Graphical User Interfaces</em> or GUIs, which are the buttons, windows, and other controls that you can point-and-click on, but this way of controlling a computer comes with severe limitations. Chief among these is the fact that you are limited to using only one tip of one finger on one of your hands (called your <em>pointer</em> or <em>mouse cursor</em>) and, worse, you have no access to anything outside of your immediate reach. In a GUI, if you cannot see it or touch it with the mouse, you cannot manipulate it.</p>

  <p>This is why almost all hackers, programmers, and system administrators prefer a Command Line Interface or CLI over the graphical options for many, if not most, of their day-to-day tasks. In a command-line, or “terminal,” you can use the complete expressive power of spoken language to control your computer. You can use symbolism and metaphor to express any idea that you have the words for. Moreover, you always have all the words you know at your disposal at any time, even if they refer to things that are far away or that you cannot currently see.</p>

  <p>In this beginner’s workshop, you’ll learn how to access the command line interface of your computer, and you’ll learn the basic grammar of command line languages such as that provided by the ubiquitous Bash command interpreter. You’ll also be introduced to the basic set of utilities required to quickly accomplish tasks that require working with files and folders, processing text, and automating common workflows that would take dozens or even hundreds of clicks with a mouse to complete in a Graphical User Interface. By learning how to “speak” to your computer using a command language, you can save hours every day and take your first step toward using your computer the way the best hackers would.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you’re doing on your computer, you’re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or “containerizing,” your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.</p>

  <p>Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a>), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">VLANs</a>) or even the whole Internet (using <a href="https://www.inetsim.org/">INetSim</a>), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a>). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes Operating System</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html">macOS’s App Sandbox</a>, and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers">Firefox Containers</a>.</p>

  <p>Whether you’re using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the <a href="https://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether it’s corporate espionage, ransomware, or online fraud, most cyber attacks don’t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called “phishing” attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won’t work unless you bite. However, <em>many</em> people do get caught up by them.</p>

  <p>In 2019, <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">ninety percent (90%!)</a> of reported <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches">data breaches</a> began with a simple phishing scam, costing businesses <a href="https://retruster.com/blog/2019-phishing-and-email-fraud-statistics.html">over $12 billion in losses</a>. Phishing attacks are the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today, with <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/about/press-room/releases/nearly-15-million-new-phishing-sites">one and a half million new phishing websites launched every month</a>. Thankfully, it’s easy to spot—and even to perform—these tricks if you have the right guidance.</p>

  <p>For example, when you’re at a cafe and you ask the patron next to you to watch your belongings, your stuff will probably be safe when you return. But how safe would you feel if the patron at the next table turned to you and <em>offered</em> to watch your belongings when you next needed to use the restroom? If you had two different reactions to these scenarios, you already have the intuition you need to understand how the overwhelming majority of cybercrime gets a foothold inside your company, home, or organization’s network.</p>

  <p>In this workshop, derived from a portion of the <a href="/courses/sec101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s popular “Hacking with Mr. Robot” Security 101 course</a>, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.</p>

<p>As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to 15 students, so <a href="#tickets-workshop-2020-03-12-gone-phishing-how-to-recognize-fake-websites-and-other-online-scams">purchase your ticket now</a> to reserve your spot.</p>

<p>To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>. You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.</p>

<p>If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="/faq/#workshops-and-webinars">our workshops and webinars FAQ</a> for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.</p>

<p>As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior <em>will</em> result in immediate removal from class without a refund.

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted “the Dark Web” as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and “hidden services” work and you’ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!</p>

  <p>In this deep dive workshop on Tor, the Tech Learning Collective’s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They’ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you’ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the “Dark Web” actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you’ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. This class is for everyone; whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.</p>
