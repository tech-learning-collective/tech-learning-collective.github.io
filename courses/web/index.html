            <p>You use them every day, but do you <em>really</em> know what a website is made of? Does creating simple visual effects like text layers or auto-scaling images with CSS still feel more like magic than designing? Although Web design and development methodologies have advanced far beyond their original days, the fundamentals of Web technologies like HTML and CSS have not changed much. It’s still important to write semantically-meaningful markup and design the look and feel of those pages using simple, maintainable stylesheets. Unfortunately, it’s harder than ever to find a good introduction to the basics: where should you use an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;article&gt;</code> and where should you use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code>, what is a CSS formatting context, how do you find an element’s most recently positioned ancestor, and why does that matter?</p>

<p>In this course, students will solidify their understanding of the most important—and most often overlooked—parts of Web fundamentals. Starting from the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/">RDFa</a>, learn how to publish any information on the Web. From simple typography to modern CSS layouts, students will master the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">in-browser development tools</a> so that by the end of the course, students will not only have created a fully-functional web site but will also know how to debug any rendering issue they encounter.</p>

            <p>Using the built-in features of modern Web browsers and their support for technologies like CSS3, a single HTML document can simultaneously be a scrollable and interactive presentation when viewed online, a picture-perfect paper brochure when printed, and even an installed app when launched from your smartphone’s home screen. Moreover, the Web as we know it today could not do what it does without a plethora of additional technologies like SVG for resolution-independent imagery or RSS and Atom for syndicated articles from blogs and news outlets. These alternate document formats and markup languages can be styled, tweaked, and customized using CSS, and CSS in turn borrows some of its more advanced features like animations, graphical filters, and modern layout concepts from those XML-based formats.</p>

<p>Building on the fundamentals introduced in <a href="/courses/web101.html">WEB101</a>, students in this course will take their Web design and development skills to the next level by mastering modern design techniques such as the Flexbox and Grid Layout CSS3 modules, Web Fonts, CSS-based animations, transitions, filter effets, and more. We will also thoroughly cover the Scalable Vector Graphics XML dialect, which is increasingly found embedded directly into Web pages. By the end of this course, students will have added techniques and technologies to their toolkit beyond mere HTML for a much broader view of what “the Web” is and what they can do with it.</p>
