<p>To help ensure you have the best possible learning experience, we suggest you consider working through at least some of our <a href="{% link foundations/index.md %}">free and self-paced Foundations courses</a> before the start of your first class. These additional, free online courses offer the best foundation on which to build your skills regardless of which subject matter you are most interested in. While we feel that the <a href="{% link foundations/index.md %}">Tech Learning Collective Foundations courses</a> are very helpful, you can still apply to any of the other courses listed here without completing our Foundations course series.</p>
