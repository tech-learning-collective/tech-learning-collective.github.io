<p>You use them every day, but do you <em>really</em> know what a website is made of? Does creating simple visual effects like text layers or auto-scaling images with CSS still feel more like magic than designing? Although Web design and development methodologies have advanced far beyond their original days, the fundamentals of Web technologies like HTML and CSS have not changed much. It’s still important to write semantically-meaningful markup and design the look and feel of those pages using simple, maintainable stylesheets. Unfortunately, it’s harder than ever to find a good introduction to the basics: where should you use an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;article&gt;</code> and where should you use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code>, what is a CSS formatting context, how do you find an element’s most recently positioned ancestor, and why does that matter?</p>

<p>In this course, students will solidify their understanding of the most important—and most often overlooked—parts of Web fundamentals. Starting from the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/">RDFa</a>, learn how to publish any information on the Web. From simple typography to modern CSS layouts, students will master the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">in-browser development tools</a> so that by the end of the course, students will not only have created a fully-functional web site but will also know how to debug any rendering issue they encounter.</p>
