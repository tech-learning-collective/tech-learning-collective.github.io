    <h2>Pre-enrollment Application Invoice</h2>
    <p>Thank you for submitting a pre-enrollment application for <span id="course-id">a Tech Learning Collective course</span>. We require prospective students to pay a non-refundable ${{ site.payments.prices.application_fee }} USD application fee in order to continue the pre-enrollment process.</p>
    <p>Your application fee payment ensures that we can continue to provide potential students with accurate and high-quality guidance during the pre-enrollment process. Moreover, your application fee rolls into your course tuition, which means that if you are ultimately accepted as a student, a portion of your course tuition equal to the application fee amount will already have been paid. <a href="{% link pricing/index.md %}">Learn more about course pricing</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Please complete your payment below to continue.</p>
