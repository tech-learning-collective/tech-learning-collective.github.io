<meta name="description" content="The Personal Telco Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Portland, Oregon dedicated to the idea that users have a central role in how their communications networks are operated. We do that by building our own networks that we share with our communities, and by helping to educate others in how they can too. To date, we have done this using Wi-Fi technology. We began in 2000 by turning our own houses and apartments into wireless hotspots (or “nodes”), and then set about building networks in public locations such as parks and coffee shops. There are currently about 100 active nodes participating in our project. We would like to see people and businesses in every corner and on every block of the city participating." />
