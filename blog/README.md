# The `blog` folder

This folder contains templates for publishing blog posts. Unless you want to heavily customize your website, you should avoid changing anything in this folder. To publish new blog posts, write new posts in [the `_posts` folder](../_posts/README.md#the-_posts-folder) instead of this folder.

The following list briefly describes some of the files in this folder and their purpose:

* `index.html` - Your blog's front page. A paginated view of your latest blog posts are generated by this template.
* `feed.xml` - Your blog's (Atomic) RSS feed. This template generates the file accessed by news readers and other software that has subscribed to your site to receive automatic updates of any new blog posts you publish. To change certain things about this subscription, edit [your site's main `rss` feed settings](../README.md#rss-feed-settings).
