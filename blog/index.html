        <p>As the United States gears up for what is arguably one of the most highly contentious General Election seasons in a long time, we wanted to share our thoughts about the importance—and limitations—of voting, and how our political credo in this arena shapes our curriculum and our priorities. Our goal, as always, is to make it easier for you to succeed at truly impactful political work through mastery of digital and information systems. But before we have a chance in Hell of making a dent there, it’s important to have an accurate understanding of how things actually work in the world, so we understand where to focus our limited resources.</p>

        <p>In a far-reaching interview on the Hackers On Planet Earth 2020 conference’s Internet radio broadcast, Radio Statler, Tech Learning Collective discusses our philosophical approach to computer technology, hacking, anarcho-autonomism, and more. We also lead three offensive cybersecurity workshops at the HOPE 2020 workshops track this year, made possible by the conference organizer’s decision to make the event a wholly-virtual one. Our own hope for the event is that people who are looking for a liberatory and ambitious direction that goes beyond but overlaps with the famous hacker ethos exemplified by the HOPE 2020 conference and community can find what they’re looking for in the form of Tech Learning Collective’s approach to queering hackerdom and returning the magic to computers.</p>

        <p>The recent spike in enrollment rates at Tech Learning Collective courses and workshops gave us a great opportunity to look closely at how we do what we do so that we can continue offering our best-in-class technical training via free, by-donation, and low-cost events supporting radical organizers and revolutionary communities. By interviewing newer repeat students, we’ve been able to improve our Web site, workshop descriptions, and even come up with new events. But these interviews also offer current or prospective students an illuminating look at Tech Learning Collective itself, our history, our motivations, and what makes us different from other tech schools or other digital education initiatives. Published with our students’ permission, the Tech Learning Collective Student Profile Series is a set of audio recordings curated from these interviews that we’ll release over time, beginning today.</p>

        <p>We at Tech Learning Collective stand with the <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/">Movement for Black Lives</a>. We stand with all those who are calling for immediate financial divestment from police departments nationwide and the reallocation of police department budgets towards investments in community housing, education, public health, and other social services. We applaud the small number of police officers so far who have laid down their batons and guns instead of using them on peaceful protesters and we insist that, next, they lay down their badges as well.</p>

        <p>In four months’ time during 2019, Tech Learning Collective produced twelve (12!) free or by-donation digital privacy training events for community groups and grassroots activists recognized by Electronic Frontier Alliance organizers. Only our fellow New Yorkers, the CyPurr Collective, held more events (13 events spread across the full 12 months), narrowly edging us out of first place. Later, we were interviewed by EFF organizers for a featured profile now published in an abridged form on the EFF Deeplinks blog. This post contains the complete unabridged interview.</p>
