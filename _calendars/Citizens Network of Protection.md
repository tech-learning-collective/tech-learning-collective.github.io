[The Citizens&rsquo; Network of Protection (CNP)](https://www.citizensnetworkofprotection.com/) is a nonprofit organization established to assist residents with filing complaints against police officers&rsquo; misconduct. CNP conducts educational events covering citizens&rsquo; rights. CNP created a proposal that promotes police accountability, transparency, and oversight, which lays the foundation for a mechanism that residents can use in dealing with police misconduct.

CNP&rsquo;s goals include promoting racial and economic justice within the legal system, preventing government overreach and abuse in the area of law enforcement, and upholding civil rights within the community. CNP will work to identify community stakeholders and work with them to form alliances to actively elevate the work and leadership of communities directly impacted by injustice in law enforcement.
