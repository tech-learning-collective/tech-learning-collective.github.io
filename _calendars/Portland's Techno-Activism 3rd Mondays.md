[Techno-Activism Third Mondays (TA3M)](https://www.meetup.com/Portlands-Techno-Activism-3rd-Mondays/) is an informal meetup designed to connect software creators and activists who are interested in censorship, surveillance, and open technology. Portland's TA3M does meetups on all of the above topics (and more!). The format varies from month to month. Sometimes we have fantastic speakers, sometimes we do lightning talks, and sometimes we do hands-on workshops. It all depends on what our meetup attendees are interested in hearing about, and what we have time to plan. Have a suggestion for a topic? Let us know!
