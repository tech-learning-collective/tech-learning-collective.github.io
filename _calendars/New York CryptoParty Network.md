Learn how to stay safe, private, and secure online. A CryptoParty is free, public and fun. People bring their computers, mobile devices, and a willingness to learn! In the time of the event people will learn and teach how to use basic cryptography tools. CryptoParties are decentralized global events that are organized to answer questions and instruct people on technology &amp; privacy. CryptoParties are always free to attend, public, commercially and politically non-aligned and absolutely against sexual harassment and discrimination. There are no dumb questions, you do not need to know anything about this subject, nor do you even need to bring a computer or phone. However that will help you get the most of it. For more information see the global cryptoparty website: [cryptoparty.in](https://cryptoparty.in/)
