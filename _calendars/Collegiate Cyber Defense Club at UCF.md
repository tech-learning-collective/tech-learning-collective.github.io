[The Collegiate Cyber Defense Club at University of Central Florida](https://www.hackucf.org/) strives to foster a generation that is aware of information security, specifically in the Central Florida area. We expect to fulfill our mission through getting the campus community involved in the cyber realm through education and experience in both offensive and defensive security strategies.
