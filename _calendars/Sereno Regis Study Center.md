The [Sereno Regis Study Center (Italian: Centro Studi Sereno Regis)](https://serenoregis.org/) is an Italian non-profit, independent, volunteer organisation founded in 1982 by MIR-Movimento Internazionale della Riconciliazione (the Italian branch of IFOR-International Fellowship of Reconciliation) and Movimento Nonviolento (Nonviolent Movement, the Italian affiliate to WRI-War Resisters International) whose mission is to spread the culture of peace and nonviolence.

This means to us face all the aspects of violence, including direct, cultural and structural. We organize our efforts around 3 pillars:

* research (to demonstrate that nonviolence can be possible and it is not an utopia),
* education (to increase the number of people that know what it means to apply nonviolence in human society), and finally
* nonviolent action (because nonviolence is effective if it becomes a bottom-up programme of changing society).
