[CRASH Space](https://crashspace.org/) is non-profit organization located in Los Angeles and run by volunteers. It is a part of the growing global hackerspace movement. We are a collection of hackers, programmers, builders, makers, and artists. We promote science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) by teaching classes, participating in events, providing on-line resources, and by running a shared workshop. Our members use the space to work on their projects, share ideas, and help each other create whatever they envision.
