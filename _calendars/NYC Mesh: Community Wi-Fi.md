The Internet is central to our lives, but in New York City, many people cannot afford access.

[NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net/) is a 501(c)3 non-profit made up of a diverse group of volunteers dedicated to bringing affordable internet to our city. You can help by joining our network to extend it to areas in need and help end the digital divide.

We are a neutral network and we do not monitor, collect, store or block any user data or content. By joining our network you agree to extend it to others!
