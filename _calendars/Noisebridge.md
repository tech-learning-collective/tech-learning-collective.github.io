[Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net/) is an accessible, community-operated, non-profit hackerspace for artists and audiences interested in the intersection of art, technology, and creative expression. We are a place to learn, play, create, and share. Our facilities seek to provide infrastructure for work utilizing textiles, music, wood, metal, computer programming, electronics, science, robotics, space for performance or display, and collaboration.
