[Citizens, Rise](https://citizensrise.org/) believes in the power of the Media. Control the messaging and change the minds.

Citizens Rise believes in the power of the Community.

We hold monthly events to get the news behind the news from the people with partners like ACLU, Planned Parenthood, immigration rightsâ€™ nonprofits like SIREN, experts in Constitutional law.

To do all this you need to know how to be an engaged citizen. We will provide information and knowledge on this page as to how governance works pertinent to the latest issues, ways to be in touch with your political representatives at all levels, and the activist organizations that you can become involved in or support.
