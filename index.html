    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The amount I’m learning in Tech Learning Collective workshops is way more than what I was learning in my college classroom. As a computer science major, most of the curriculum was all about theory and had very little practical work. TLC more than fills in that gap for me. Another reason I’m frequenting TLC events is for their community! I would’ve never known how vibrant TLC’s alternative tech community was. I’m definitely looking forward to participating in as many Tech Learning Collective events and courses as possible.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>[A]fter checking the[ir <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">Gone Phishing</a> workshop] out, I highly recommend!! I’ve gone to a lot of meetups, including a few cybersecurity workshops, and what they are doing is really top of the line. The workshop was a good middle ground of welcoming for beginners, but still engaging for more experienced people. I learned so much! It was well-paced and had a tight, manageable scope, but I also walked away with a ton of links of additional resources to explore on my own time. So if you’re in the NYC area and have the chance, definitely check out <a href="/events/">their calendar</a>!</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I joined <a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Tech Learning Collective’s “Practical Digital Security” workshop</a> because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how “doxing” happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.</p>

<p>But there was so much more, too. I’m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.</p>
