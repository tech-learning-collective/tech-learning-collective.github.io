        <p>In four months’ time during 2019, Tech Learning Collective produced twelve (12!) free or by-donation digital privacy training events for community groups and grassroots activists recognized by Electronic Frontier Alliance organizers. Only our fellow New Yorkers, the CyPurr Collective, held more events (13 events spread across the full 12 months), narrowly edging us out of first place. Later, we were interviewed by EFF organizers for a featured profile now published in an abridged form on the EFF Deeplinks blog. This post contains the complete unabridged interview.</p>

        <p>The global movement for justice will end tragically if we do not dramatically and immediately invest in digital infrastructure education with a competency and urgency like never before, so we wrapped up our Hacker Trivia Night benefit weekend to support local businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with a call to action to ramp up the level of ambition that we have for ourselves in our fight for justice.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I joined <a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Tech Learning Collective’s “Practical Digital Security” workshop</a> because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how “doxing” happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.</p>

<p>But there was so much more, too. I’m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I found Tech Learning Collective recently through <a href="/2019/08/13/joining-the-electronic-frontier-alliance.html">their membership in the Electronic Frontier Alliance</a> and jumped right in to many of their great learning opportunities. The <a href="/workshops/Taming-Daemons-System-Administration-and-Operation-Basics">System Administration and Operation Basics workshop</a> is a great example. The instruction was very thorough and responsive to where students are in the tech learning process. After the session I now feel like I have a strong foundation of understanding that I can build upon in setting up tech for my business.</p>

<p>I’m excited to continue learning with the Tech Learning Collective team and recommend them to anyone seeking to understand the complex tech world we live in every day.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I found out about Tech Learning Collective through an Electronic Frontier Foundation article about <a href="/2020/04/02/mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights.html">an event they where hosting regarding cybersecurity</a>.</p>

<p>What I really liked about it, is that they where very supportive to newbies (like me) and I wasn’t too overwhelmed during the event. They made it as simple as they could. The communication between the audience and the presenter (and the teacher’s assistant) was really nice too. They tried to answer as many questions as possible and kept going for almost two hours after the event was supposed to end.</p>

<p>Among other things I learned a lot about the <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-Is-It-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything)">Tor Browser</a>, brute-force attacks, and how <a href="/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers">password hashing</a> works.</p>
