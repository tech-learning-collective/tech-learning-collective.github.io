    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>Putin’s brutal aggression in Ukraine has put cyberwar back in headlines. Recently, Carey Parker, host of the <a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/">Firewalls Don’t Stop Dragons</a> podcast, reached out to us at Tech Learning Collective to talk through some of the issues the war in Ukraine has once again raised for laypeople who may be newly concerned about the reliance we’ve developed as a society on digital infrastructures. So, late last month, we sat down with him for another conversation about what anyone and, arguably, everyone could be doing not only to keep themselves safer online, but also prepared in the event of an escalation of hostilities in a cyber theater, rapid shifts in political climates, or even just natural disasters that affect telecommunication abilities.</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, we republished <a href="/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html">part 1 of our interview with The Enragés</a>, where we discussed our blog post, <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future</a>. In this post, you’ll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained people’s telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The workshop I most recently attended, <a href="/workshops/File-Sharing-for-Fun-and-Profit-How-BitTorrent-Works-and-What-You-Can-Do-With-It">File Sharing for Fun and Profit</a>, was extremely well organized and was a great presentation demonstrating the ease of using BitTorrent as well as its benefits. Better still, since the instructor at every TLC workshop I’ve attended so far mentions resources that I probably wouldn’t have learned as much about in other ways, I’m often able to double the number of valuable resources I get from attending the workshop by entering the names of things I learn about from the workshop into the search box of several search engines.</p>

<p>It’s clear that TLC’s instructors possess a deep reservoir of knowledge about BitTorrent and the other subjects in their curriculum.  I’d encourage anyone wishing to learn more about BitTorrent, <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor</a>, <a href="/workshops/Securing-Email-Protecting-Everyday-Communications-from-GMail-to-ProtonMail">PGP</a>, <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>, etcetera, to <a href="/enrollment/">enroll</a> in a TLC workshop or course in order to get the opportunity to draw from this rich reservoir!</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor workshop [I attended]</a> was very slow, considered, and thorough, providing hours of spacious learning and the space to fully comprehend and learn. Although I did write down notes, I doubt I’ll need to refer to them, because of the pacing and thoroughness of understanding each step.</p>

<p>Rather than cramming too much information to retain, the tutor respectfully provided the core information repetitively, from multiple nuanced perspectives. That way, it’s gone in, I have done the learning while in the workshop, as opposed to needing to reread notes after the fact, and try to make sense of the information.</p>

<p>It was inclusive and respectful, and even the platform kinda helps with that, which gives you a screen of an avatar, and the option to collaborate either with your mic for voices, or by typing in the chat box.</p>

<p>Thanks again, TLC! I feel empowered to do this now!</p>

I’ve gone to a lot of meetups, including a few cybersecurity workshops, and what they are doing is really top of the line. The workshop was a good middle ground of welcoming for beginners, but still engaging for more experienced people. I learned so much! It was well-paced and had a tight, manageable scope, but I also walked away with a ton of links of additional resources to explore on my own time. So if you’re in the NYC area and have the chance, definitely check out <a href="/events/">their calendar</a>!</p>
