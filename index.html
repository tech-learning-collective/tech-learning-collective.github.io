    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>Putin’s brutal aggression in Ukraine has put cyberwar back in headlines. Recently, Carey Parker, host of the <a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/">Firewalls Don’t Stop Dragons</a> podcast, reached out to us at Tech Learning Collective to talk through some of the issues the war in Ukraine has once again raised for laypeople who may be newly concerned about the reliance we’ve developed as a society on digital infrastructures. So, late last month, we sat down with him for another conversation about what anyone and, arguably, everyone could be doing not only to keep themselves safer online, but also prepared in the event of an escalation of hostilities in a cyber theater, rapid shifts in political climates, or even just natural disasters that affect telecommunication abilities.</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, we republished <a href="/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html">part 1 of our interview with The Enragés</a>, where we discussed our blog post, <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future</a>. In this post, you’ll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained people’s telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I joined <a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Tech Learning Collective’s “Practical Digital Security” workshop</a> because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how “doxing” happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.</p>

<p>But there was so much more, too. I’m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.</p>

<p>What I really liked about it, is that they were very supportive to newbies (like me) and I wasn’t too overwhelmed during the event. They made it as simple as they could. The communication between the audience and the presenter (and the teacher’s assistant) was really nice too. They tried to answer as many questions as possible and kept going for almost two hours after the event was supposed to end.</p>

<p>Among other things I learned a lot about the <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor Browser</a>, brute-force attacks, and how <a href="/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers">password hashing</a> works.</p>
