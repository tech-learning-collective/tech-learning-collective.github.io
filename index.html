The workshop was thorough but unintimidating and the instructor did a good job of checking the group’s temperature and staying in tune with our respective paces of learning and skill set. Also I <em>really</em> appreciate the femme-friendly communications and price structure.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>Outstanding webinar taught by a phenomenal instructor! [My TLC instructor] was not only a wealth of knowledge, but was also engaging, patient, and knew how to explain even the most complex concepts in a way that everyone can understand. As a software teacher myself, I always appreciate high-quality instruction that not only educates, but also does so in a fun, and efficient manner. I can safely say that I have learned more about computers in the single Tech Learning Collective “<a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</a>” workshop I attended than I have in four years of college. I cannot recommend the Tech Learning Collective highly enough!</p>
