    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>Putin’s brutal aggression in Ukraine has put cyberwar back in headlines. Recently, Carey Parker, host of the <a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/">Firewalls Don’t Stop Dragons</a> podcast, reached out to us at Tech Learning Collective to talk through some of the issues the war in Ukraine has once again raised for laypeople who may be newly concerned about the reliance we’ve developed as a society on digital infrastructures. So, late last month, we sat down with him for another conversation about what anyone and, arguably, everyone could be doing not only to keep themselves safer online, but also prepared in the event of an escalation of hostilities in a cyber theater, rapid shifts in political climates, or even just natural disasters that affect telecommunication abilities.</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, we republished <a href="/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html">part 1 of our interview with The Enragés</a>, where we discussed our blog post, <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future</a>. In this post, you’ll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained people’s telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The workshop I most recently attended, <a href="/workshops/File-Sharing-for-Fun-and-Profit-How-BitTorrent-Works-and-What-You-Can-Do-With-It">File Sharing for Fun and Profit</a>, was extremely well organized and was a great presentation demonstrating the ease of using BitTorrent as well as its benefits. Better still, since the instructor at every TLC workshop I’ve attended so far mentions resources that I probably wouldn’t have learned as much about in other ways, I’m often able to double the number of valuable resources I get from attending the workshop by entering the names of things I learn about from the workshop into the search box of several search engines.</p>

<p>It’s clear that TLC’s instructors possess a deep reservoir of knowledge about BitTorrent and the other subjects in their curriculum.  I’d encourage anyone wishing to learn more about BitTorrent, <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor</a>, <a href="/workshops/Securing-Email-Protecting-Everyday-Communications-from-GMail-to-ProtonMail">PGP</a>, <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>, etcetera, to <a href="/enrollment/">enroll</a> in a TLC workshop or course in order to get the opportunity to draw from this rich reservoir!</p>

<p>The instructor was personable, friendly, and warm, with a keen vision of the change they want to see in the world and the ability to draw that vision into reality using self-direction and their unique and valuable gifts. They use analogies and examples to demystify complex subjects and connect, and anchor, abstract concepts to concrete understanding. They are kind, helpful, informative, and empowering to students.</p>

<p>The information was presented in an organized fashion, with step-by-step guidance that eliminated confusion in even the most inexperienced novice. The class is geared toward creating positive change in students’ lives by helping them better understand their use of internet security and privacy. Everything taught was highly applicable and useful to the common person. (These classes work to level the playing field between those with innate technological interest/skill and those without.)</p>

<p>The teaching methods used (analogies, examples, demonstration, verbal explanation, and hands-on practice) address the needs of all different kinds of learners in the classroom. The flow of the class was seamless. The incorporation of questions and answers was so helpful, and the progression of the material was logical and conducive to learning. There were frequent “comprehension checks” which made the material and instructor accessible to students throughout class.</p>

<p>I could go on, but TLDR: This class was immensely valuable, and changed my core beliefs about my technological proficiency and potential.</p>
