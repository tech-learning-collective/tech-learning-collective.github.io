    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>Two days after the American far right’s failed fascist coup on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021 that left five people dead in Washington, DC, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">Twitter (finally) permanently banned the would-be dictator</a> responsible for inciting the mob from their platform. Shortly thereafter, the social media network most closely affiliated with the racist reactionaries, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.html">Parler, was kicked off its cloud provider’s hosting platform</a>, Amazon AWS. This meant Parler’s servers were shut down, bringing the social media platform down with them, at least temporarily. While de-platforming Trump and Parler is undoubtedly a good thing in the short term (and should have happened a long time ago), the sheer visibility of such high-profile bans is likely to dramatically accelerate the adoption of certain communication technologies that are much harder to shut down the same way Parler was.</p>

        <p>In the last half century, computing power made at least three great migrations. The pendulum swung from centralized to decentralized, and then back to (kind of) centralized again. Next time the pendulum swings—and it will—what might the catalyzing event be? What shape might the networks that connect our modern world take? And to what ends might we apply such a shift in compute power?</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor workshop [I attended]</a> was very slow, considered, and thorough, providing hours of spacious learning and the space to fully comprehend and learn. Although I did write down notes, I doubt I’ll need to refer to them, because of the pacing and thoroughness of understanding each step.</p>

<p>Rather than cramming too much information to retain, the tutor respectfully provided the core information repetitively, from multiple nuanced perspectives. That way, it’s gone in, I have done the learning while in the workshop, as opposed to needing to reread notes after the fact, and try to make sense of the information.</p>

<p>It was inclusive and respectful, and even the platform kinda helps with that, which gives you a screen of an avatar, and the option to collaborate either with your mic for voices, or by typing in the chat box.</p>

<p>Thanks again, TLC! I feel empowered to do this now!</p>

They are fluent in this stuff, plain and simple, and quite good at explaining dense, complicated topics. As someone who is new to the “behind-the-scenes” of today’s technologies, I feel that I have benefited greatly from their events. After each workshop, I have numerous takeaways that help me continue to learn on my own time, but I keep coming back to their live workshops because of the quality of the instruction. I cannot overemphasize how highly I recommend Tech Learning Collective.</p>
