    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>Putin’s brutal aggression in Ukraine has put cyberwar back in headlines. Recently, Carey Parker, host of the <a href="https://firewallsdontstopdragons.com/">Firewalls Don’t Stop Dragons</a> podcast, reached out to us at Tech Learning Collective to talk through some of the issues the war in Ukraine has once again raised for laypeople who may be newly concerned about the reliance we’ve developed as a society on digital infrastructures. So, late last month, we sat down with him for another conversation about what anyone and, arguably, everyone could be doing not only to keep themselves safer online, but also prepared in the event of an escalation of hostilities in a cyber theater, rapid shifts in political climates, or even just natural disasters that affect telecommunication abilities.</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, we republished <a href="/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html">part 1 of our interview with The Enragés</a>, where we discussed our blog post, <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future</a>. In this post, you’ll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained people’s telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.</p>

The workshop was thorough but unintimidating and the instructor did a good job of checking the group’s temperature and staying in tune with our respective paces of learning and skill set. Also I <em>really</em> appreciate the femme-friendly communications and price structure.</p>

I’ve gone to a lot of meetups, including a few cybersecurity workshops, and what they are doing is really top of the line. The workshop was a good middle ground of welcoming for beginners, but still engaging for more experienced people. I learned so much! It was well-paced and had a tight, manageable scope, but I also walked away with a ton of links of additional resources to explore on my own time. So if you’re in the NYC area and have the chance, definitely check out <a href="/events/">their calendar</a>!</p>
