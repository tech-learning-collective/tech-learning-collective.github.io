        <p>When Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet in the 1970’s, he intentionally designed his system in a way that would function anarchically. Many engineers believed this approach was too chaotic to succeed. How could a system of coordination function with no command center? It would be pure anarchy! Today, every Internet connection, local network, telephone uplink, datacenter backhaul, and Wi-Fi signal to your computer uses Ethernet. The anarchist approach proved simpler, more efficient, and ultimately more successful. This is no surprise to any practicing anarchist, although many practicing anarchists still won’t recognize the anarchism in action when they post their next Tweet. Meanwhile, most Big Tech insiders aren’t able to see the parallels between their beloved technology and the anarchist viewpoint. This must change, and we’re going to change it.</p>

        <p>This week’s issue of Martha Hipley’s “An Artist’s Guide to Computation” features an interview with Tech Learning Collective. We answer questions about what makes us different from code bootcamps and even other advocacy/community groups (short answer: we’re not doing what they’re doing), why we focus on communications security at every step of our curriculum (safe and secure communication is a prerequisite to political change), what to do if your friends say they hate Facebook but still aren’t ready to take action to protect their privacy online (change more of your own behavior first rather than debating the merits of your choices with them), how the year 2020 has radically transformed Tech Learning Collective’s own infrastructure (we’re 100% online now), and more.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The workshop I most recently attended, <a href="/workshops/File-Sharing-for-Fun-and-Profit-How-BitTorrent-Works-and-What-You-Can-Do-With-It">File Sharing for Fun and Profit</a>, was extremely well organized and was a great presentation demonstrating the ease of using BitTorrent as well as its benefits. Better still, since the instructor at every TLC workshop I’ve attended so far mentions resources that I probably wouldn’t have learned as much about in other ways, I’m often able to double the number of valuable resources I get from attending the workshop by entering the names of things I learn about from the workshop into the search box of several search engines.</p>

<p>It’s clear that TLC’s instructors possess a deep reservoir of knowledge about BitTorrent and the other subjects in their curriculum.  I’d encourage anyone wishing to learn more about BitTorrent, <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor</a>, <a href="/workshops/Securing-Email-Protecting-Everyday-Communications-from-GMail-to-ProtonMail">PGP</a>, <a href="/workshops/Signal-and-Surveillance-How-to-Exercise-Digital-Civil-Liberties-in-a-Surveillance-State">Signal</a>, etcetera, to <a href="/enrollment/">enroll</a> in a TLC workshop or course in order to get the opportunity to draw from this rich reservoir!</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p><a href="/workshops/Securing-Email-Protecting-Everyday-Communications-from-GMail-to-ProtonMail">TLC’s workshop on securing email</a> was very well organized and easy to follow. At every step of the way during demonstrations, actions taken were clearly explained along with their intended purpose. The instructor’s delivery was cogent, concise, and free of unnecessary technical jargon. The instructor facilitated an informative conversation with attendees about encryption and related issues. This workshop provided a convincing case for using encryption and demonstrated how easily it can be implemented. I look forward to setting up encryption for my personal communications and reaping the benefits.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The amount I’m learning in Tech Learning Collective workshops is way more than what I was learning in my college classroom. As a computer science major, most of the curriculum was all about theory and had very little practical work. TLC more than fills in that gap for me. Another reason I’m frequenting TLC events is for their community! I would’ve never known how vibrant TLC’s alternative tech community was. I’m definitely looking forward to participating in as many Tech Learning Collective events and courses as possible.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I found out about Tech Learning Collective through an Electronic Frontier Foundation article about <a href="/2020/04/02/mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights.html">an event they where hosting regarding cybersecurity</a>.</p>

<p>What I really liked about it, is that they where very supportive to newbies (like me) and I wasn’t too overwhelmed during the event. They made it as simple as they could. The communication between the audience and the presenter (and the teacher’s assistant) was really nice too. They tried to answer as many questions as possible and kept going for almost two hours after the event was supposed to end.</p>

<p>Among other things I learned a lot about the <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor Browser</a>, brute-force attacks, and how <a href="/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers">password hashing</a> works.</p>
