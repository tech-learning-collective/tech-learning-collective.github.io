        <p>Earlier this month, we republished <a href="/2021/05/01/the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1.html">part 1 of our interview with The Enragés</a>, where we discussed our blog post, <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">Imagining an Optimistic Cyber-Future</a>. In this post, you’ll find the conclusion of our conversation along with a (somewhat rushed) transcript of the same. Here, we touch on ways in which capitalism has constrained people’s telecommunication abilities, we describe some of our inspiration from earlier political thinkers, and we even answer a couple of listener questions.</p>

        <p>Back in January, we published <a href="/2021/01/05/imagining-an-optimistic-cyber-future.html">an imaginary of an optimistic cyber-future</a>. A couple months after it was syndicated by the <a href="https://c4ss.org/content/54188">Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS)</a>, Joel Williamson (of <a href="https://nonserviam.media/">Non Serviam Media</a> renown) invited us to join him on an episode of the C4SS’s new podcast, <a href="https://c4ss.org/content/category/the-enrages">The Enragés</a>, to discuss the piece in more depth. The ensuing two-hour conversation was recorded and published as a two-part interview that we are excited to present here.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>During the anti-globalization movement of the early 2000s, tech collectives such as <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup</a> and <a href="https://www.autistici.org/">Autistici</a> came into existence to provide autonomous, non-corporate communication tools and “How-Tos” for social movements to organize safely and securely with emerging new media. In South Africa, the <a href="https://www.r2k.org.za/">Right2Know</a> campaign was initiated in 2010 in response to the Protection of State Information Bill, which aimed at weakening the rights of journalists and whistleblowers to access information. As part of their work, R2K has published <a href="https://www.r2k.org.za/2020/09/01/digitalsecurity/">guides for activists</a> to protect themselves digitally.</p>

<p>To heighten my own digital defense practice, I recently took a virtual workshop offered by the New York-based <a href="https://techlearningcollective.com/">Tech Learning Collective</a>. This collective provides technology education for radical organizers and revolutionary communities with special attention to underserved groups. These groups, which design tools and training for activists, are not a new occurrence.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I joined <a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Tech Learning Collective’s “Practical Digital Security” workshop</a> because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how “doxing” happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.</p>

<p>But there was so much more, too. I’m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I found out about Tech Learning Collective through an Electronic Frontier Foundation article about <a href="/2020/04/02/mr-robots-hacker-happy-hour-highlights.html">an event they were hosting regarding cybersecurity</a>.</p>

<p>What I really liked about it, is that they were very supportive to newbies (like me) and I wasn’t too overwhelmed during the event. They made it as simple as they could. The communication between the audience and the presenter (and the teacher’s assistant) was really nice too. They tried to answer as many questions as possible and kept going for almost two hours after the event was supposed to end.</p>

<p>Among other things I learned a lot about the <a href="/workshops/Tor-What-is-it-Good-For-(Absolutely-Everything!)">Tor Browser</a>, brute-force attacks, and how <a href="/workshops/Password-Superpowers-How-to-Crack-Hashes-and-Stump-Hackers">password hashing</a> works.</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>The amount I’m learning in Tech Learning Collective workshops is way more than what I was learning in my college classroom. As a computer science major, most of the curriculum was all about theory and had very little practical work. TLC more than fills in that gap for me. Another reason I’m frequenting TLC events is for their community! I would’ve never known how vibrant TLC’s alternative tech community was. I’m definitely looking forward to participating in as many Tech Learning Collective events and courses as possible.</p>
