    <div class="e-content entry-content">
        <p>When Bob Metcalfe invented Ethernet in the 1970’s, he intentionally designed his system in a way that would function anarchically. Many engineers believed this approach was too chaotic to succeed. How could a system of coordination function with no command center? It would be pure anarchy! Today, every Internet connection, local network, telephone uplink, datacenter backhaul, and Wi-Fi signal to your computer uses Ethernet. The anarchist approach proved simpler, more efficient, and ultimately more successful. This is no surprise to any practicing anarchist, although many practicing anarchists still won’t recognize the anarchism in action when they post their next Tweet. Meanwhile, most Big Tech insiders aren’t able to see the parallels between their beloved technology and the anarchist viewpoint. This must change, and we’re going to change it.</p>

        <p>This week’s issue of Martha Hipley’s “An Artist’s Guide to Computation” features an interview with Tech Learning Collective. We answer questions about what makes us different from code bootcamps and even other advocacy/community groups (short answer: we’re not doing what they’re doing), why we focus on communications security at every step of our curriculum (safe and secure communication is a prerequisite to political change), what to do if your friends say they hate Facebook but still aren’t ready to take action to protect their privacy online (change more of your own behavior first rather than debating the merits of your choices with them), how the year 2020 has radically transformed Tech Learning Collective’s own infrastructure (we’re 100% online now), and more.</p>

[My TLC instructor] was not only a wealth of knowledge, but was also engaging, patient, and knew how to explain even the most complex concepts in a way that everyone can understand. As a software teacher myself, I always appreciate high-quality instruction that not only educates, but also does so in a fun, and efficient manner. I can safely say that I have learned more about computers in the single Tech Learning Collective “<a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Digital Defenses for the People: Practical Digital Security</a>” workshop I attended than I have in four years of college.

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>I joined <a href="/workshops/Digital-Defenses-for-the-People-Practical-Digital-Security">Tech Learning Collective’s “Practical Digital Security” workshop</a> because I had heard how easy it was to find out personal information about people on websites without their knowledge or permission and their workshop description promised to show me how I could protect myself from this sort of thing.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint! Not only did the workshop cover this topic directly, the instructor showed us exactly how “doxing” happens and the specific data broker websites that are used. For me, it was enlightening to learn about specific companies involved (augh, Facebook, of course!) and tools that I could use to automatically notify me of my personal information being out there, like Google Alerts and Firefox Monitor.</p>

<p>But there was so much more, too. I’m impressed at how practical and solution-oriented the whole experience felt. At the end of the workshop, I got the feeling that everyone got all their questions answered, which is really rare for classes like this.</p>

Plenty of volunteer developers have already made tools and applications to help you and your team increase safety and privacy without sacrificing functionality.</p>

<p>[Tech Learning Collective is] an amazing educational organization that can teach you all about online security. I owe much of this guide to what I have learned from them and the personal research their work has inspired. TLC has recently started to do more webinars (<a href="/events/">event calendar</a>), so their work is now accessible from anywhere!</p>

    <blockquote class="e-content description" itemprop="description"><p>[A]fter checking the[ir <a href="/workshops/Gone-Phishing-How-to-Recognize-Fake-Websites-and-Other-Online-Scams">Gone Phishing</a> workshop] out, I highly recommend!! I’ve gone to a lot of meetups, including a few cybersecurity workshops, and what they are doing is really top of the line. The workshop was a good middle ground of welcoming for beginners, but still engaging for more experienced people. I learned so much! It was well-paced and had a tight, manageable scope, but I also walked away with a ton of links of additional resources to explore on my own time. So if you’re in the NYC area and have the chance, definitely check out <a href="/events/">their calendar</a>!</p>
