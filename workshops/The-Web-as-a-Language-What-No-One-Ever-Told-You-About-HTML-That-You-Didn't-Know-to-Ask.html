    <h2>The Web as a Language: What No One Ever Told You About HTML That You Didn't Know to Ask</h2>
    
<img src="/static/images/workshop.the-web-as-a-language-what-no-one-ever-told-you-about-html-that-you-didnt-know-to-ask.square.png" alt="Poster for The Web as a Language: What No One Ever Told You About HTML That You Didn't Know to Ask" />




<p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the <em>language</em> that it actually is? What is HTML’s grammar, where do HTML “sentences” begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don’t need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.</p>

<p>This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90’s or just last week. Based on a portion of the <a href="/courses/web101.html">Tech Learning Collective’s WEB101 course</a>, it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web’s most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29">Microdata</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>, learn how to write in the Web’s native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly <em>understand</em> what you’re saying.</p>
