The Tech Learning Collective invites you to join us for *{{ page.title }}*. This two-hour workshop is a practical introduction to creating, using, and administering virtual machine (VM) systems. Even if you&rsquo;ve never heard of a virtual machine before, you probably already use the underlying technology. And you can get a lot out of using a virtual machine even if you aren&rsquo;t a software developer because they can help secure your Web browsing activity, give you a sandbox in which to try out new software, and much more!

> Virtualization and containerization are concepts almost as old as computing itself so, no matter what you&rsquo;re doing on your computer, you&rsquo;re probably using one form of it or another. For example, partitioning a hard disk chunks its total capacity into smaller units useful for specific purposes, much like the individual drawers in a dresser might separate undergarments from outerwear. Organizing, or &ldquo;containerizing,&rdquo; your closet this way is useful in its own right because it helps you keep things neat and orderly. But this organizing method also offers dramatic security enhancements because a misbehaving program (or dirty sock) will be confined to its own container.
>
> Today, virtualization has become integral to how desktop computers, servers, and global data networks work, and cross-platform, Free Software virtualization programs have never been easier to use. Storage virtualization makes it possible for a single file on your computer to appear to be an entire hard disk drive (such as provided by [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/)), network virtualization makes it possible to simulate different networks (e.g., using [VLANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)) or even the whole Internet (using [INetSim](https://www.inetsim.org/)), processor virtualization makes it possible to run programs built for one microchip architecture on computers running a completely different one (e.g., in [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)), and fully-fledged virtual machine monitors (VMMs) or hypervisors can construct and modify entire hardware environments complete with virtual video monitors and other peripherals on the fly (as is offered by [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/)). Virtualization is even the bedrock of numerous Operating System and Web browser security features, such as in the [Qubes Operating System](https://www.qubes-os.org/), [macOS&rsquo;s App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html), and [Firefox Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

> Whether you're using your computer for fun or for profit, this workshop will get you up and running with Virtual Machines using the [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org/) type-2 hypervisor so you can experiment with unfamiliar software more boldly, browse the Web more safely, and play games you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to. By learning how to take advantage of the virtualization capabilities your computer already offers, you can revive your love of that long-lost DOS point-and-click adventure, reliably build and test single- and multi-machine networked software systems, or simply create an almost unlimited number of purpose-built virtual machines that all exist, like inception, inside your existing laptop or other personal computer.

**Tickets** to this workshop are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and are only available in advance via [our online storefront](https://www.artful.ly/store/events/19035):
