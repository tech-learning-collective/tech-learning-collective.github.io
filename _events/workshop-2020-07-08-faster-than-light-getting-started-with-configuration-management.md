teaser: Learn how to beat back configuration drift on your servers by leveraging automation tools like Ansible in this deep dive workshop demonstrating modern DevOps practices for deploying, maintaining, and auditing compute clusters. Whether for a Web application, big data processing, or other project, you need to turn old-school runbooks into computerized playbooks that can execute Standard Operating Procedures quickly and reliably so you can deploy complex systems simply and predictably. Come learn about key concepts like idempotence and change control, and learn how giant corporations implement security principles like RBAC, all using free and open source software.

## Workshop Description

> Today, all but the most trivial of computer systems rely on an interdependent set of servers working in concert. You don&rsquo;t just have one server, you have a group of them. Commonly called a *cluster*, these servers need to be managed as a group, ensuring that their software configurations, security patches, and installed packages are deployed, maintained, and eventually updated or retired in a predictable way.
>
> In this deep dive workshop, we&rsquo;ll set up our own small cluster and use [Ansible](https://ansible.com/), which is an agentless, cross-platform, enterprise-grade, free software [Configuration Management (CM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) and [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)]({% link _workshops/Automate All the Things: Infrastructure as Code Primer.md %}) framework used by giant corporations like IBM and Cisco, to turn old-school operator runbooks into computerized playbooks that can be executed quickly and easily even by novice operators. Through several hands-on exercises, you&rsquo;ll learn about the entire CM lifecycle from planning through auditing so that you understand critical CM concepts like idempotence, change control, and more, which are common to all CM systems including [Chef](https://www.chef.io/configuration-management/), [Puppet](https://puppet.com/use-cases/configuration-management/), and [Salt](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/states/).
>
> Along the way, you&rsquo;ll be exposed to key concepts such as [containerization]({% link _workshops/Ship Shape Computing: Working with Containers and Containzerizing Digital Workloads.md %}) through Ansible&rsquo;s support for automating container builds, [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/con) via Ansible&rsquo;s AWX Project, and more. By adopting configuration management workflows with tools like Ansible, you can reduce operator errors, and beat back configuration drift on any long-lived infrastructure components.
