teaser: Join Vi, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event. As an active member of an LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG), Vi is hosting a post-Pride Month "How was your Pride?" Happy Hour with (limited) open bar tab, sponsored in partnership with her other employer and Tech Learning Collective. She's chosen to combine it with the next Killer Queen Open Hive Night plus her 1 year HRT anniversary. So come party with Vi, her colleagues "from work," the Tech Learning Collective staff and student body, and the NYC Killer Queen scene for a three-in-one birthday/Pride spectacular mashup celebrating NYC's newest up and coming hottie Queen Bee's 1-year traniversary!

Start Summer off with a bang. We're not talking about fireworks (although those are nice, too). We're talking about our good friend and collaborator, Vi's incredible three-in-one party night. Vi has been an incredible source of knowledge, inspiration, and persistence throughout all of Tech Learning Collective history. In partnership with others, she co-founded our school and continues to be involved in community efforts to increase the digital literacy and safety of queer and trans folks to this day.

In many past posts on our blog, as well as across the Web in [recorded podcasts]({% post_url 2021-05-01-the-enrages-next-time-the-pendulum-swings-part-1 %}) and on [Internet radio]({% post_url 2020-08-03-return-the-magic-to-computers-radio-statler-hope-2020-interview-with-tech-learning-collective %}), you can listen to her impassioned takes on Internet history and the future of technology, its impact on marginalized groups, and her critiques of Silicon Valley's approaches to "making the world a better place" all while advocating for a more technologically savvy and self-empowered relationship with digital technology. Although an enigma to many, she is nothing if not iconoclastic, embodying the very best of the trans hacker stereotype.

Today, Vi plays double-duty as a full time employee back in Silicon Valley after a long personal struggle, as well as remaining a core organizer for the Hex90 queer hacker parties in New York City, an advisor to a number of anarchist tech collectives, and of course a central figure in Tech Learning Collective operations. Vi is turning 1 year old soon, as her HRT anniversary is around the corner and, true to form, she's decided to turn her party into something more communal.

Direct from Vi "like the text editor" herself:

> Hi, friends! Pride Month has come and gone but there's one more (massive) celebration to be had!

> Join me, your friendly neighborhood trans hacker party princess, for a TRIPLE HEADER HAPPY HOUR event: the company I work for tapped me to organize a "How was your pride?" post-pride month Happy Hour, and I'm combining it with my "birthday" party and the next [Killer Queen](https://killerqueenarcade.com/) Open Hive Night at Wonderville.

> The “How was your Pride?” Happy Hour is for my co-workers in NYC, and I'm inviting them all to combine forces with the NYC Killer Queen scene for their weekly [Open Hive Night](https://www.wonderville.nyc/events/killerqueen-07-05-2022). That day is also my trans birthday celebration, so all three events are happening in the same place at the same time, all in one amazing evening!

There will also be a limited open tab courtesy the company Employee Resource Group and employee experience team for this happy hour as well and some remaining portions of the tab will be picked up by Tech Learning Collective as a thank you to the queer community who keep coming to our [workshops]({% link workshops/index.md %}). That said, please feel free to [donate to Tech Learning Collective]({% link donate/index.md %}) if you have the means to help support our work.
