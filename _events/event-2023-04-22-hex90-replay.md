teaser: Hex90 is a &ldquo;queer hacker salon&rdquo; featuring music, dancing, visuals, and special performances. The most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name. After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network with your laptop, you can launch the Hex90 game in your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. Think every 90's hacker movie party scene but gayer, and kinder! You don't need to be a hacker to enjoy the party, and TLC instructors will be at the party ready to guide you if you want to learn some basic hacking techniques!

Queer hackers of the world, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to [Hex90&rsquo;s latest queer hacker salon, &ldquo;replay,&rdquo;](https://hex90.party/) hosted at [Wonderville, where you can buy tickets](https://wonderville.nyc/).

HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC

Queer hackers of the world, unite! There's a war going on. The battlefield is in the mind. And the prize is the soul. Remember, hacking isn't just a crime. It's a survival trait.

Hacking is not merely about breaking in; it's also about breaking out. You are the embodiment of escape velocity, from megahertz to gigahertz, each of us individual components in a system that cannot keep up with its constituents. You may feel suffocated by it, trapped in its loops, history repeating itself in the closed minds of politicians, pundits, "thought leaders," or billionaires who kennel you within rings of "protection." But you are different: you have already seen what comes next.

To move forward, we sometimes must replay pieces of the past. This time, though, we are armed with the experience of a freer future. We have learned their secrets and shared them widely. We can speak their words back to them and claim the power they thought was theirs alone. We are the future they fear because we are already here, and they are the past.

They want to undo us. We will replay them, and win—again.

DANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!

In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer," the game is not available on the public Internet.)

After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.

We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.

All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.

## About [Shift-CTRL Space](https://shiftctrl.space/)

We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against &ldquo;Adtech,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fintech,&rdquo; and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one&rsquo;s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.

## About [LiveCode.NYC](https://livecode.nyc/)

We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.

## About [gwenpri.me](https://gwenpri.me/)

She enjoys finding arcane ways to put pixels on screens. Past sets have included touch designer patching, Lua DSLs, command line video editors, and more.

## About [Voyde](https://www.instagram.com/voydescreamsback)
