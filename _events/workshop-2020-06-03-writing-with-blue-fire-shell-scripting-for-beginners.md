teaser: Learn how to inscribe your thoughts, dreams, and desires into your computer and take your command line skills to the next level by learning how to write simple programs called shell scripts. In a way, invoking commands one at a time is like writing a program interactively, whereas writing a script inscribes that knowledge into a more permanent form. By learning how to turn commands into simple scripted programs, you can unlock the almost magical potential of your computer and more easily share that potential with others to whom you distribute your scripts.

## Workshop Description

> At their core, digital computers are very complex writing instruments. Like pen and paper, they allow us to record our thoughts, dreams, and desires for later review. Unlike pen and paper, they allow us to do this at the speed of electricity and at a scale never before imagined possible, and their ability to directly manipulate the physical world through servomotors, industrial control systems, biomedical devices, and other robotic prosthesis means they can potentially supercharging every facet of our humanity.
>
> When a system administrator or programmer uses a computer, they often issue instructions one by one using a special-purpose, text-only interface called a *[command line]({% link foundations/index.md %})*. Individually, these instructions are called *invocations*. (Yes, that&rsquo;s their technical term!) In this beginner&rsquo;s workshop, you&rsquo;ll learn how to write whole spells, rituals, or (sacred) texts called *shell scripts* to inscribe your own thoughts, dreams, and desires in the electrified silicon and minerals of your computer.
>
> By saving your scripts in files, you can invoke arbitrarily complex routines to reproduce tasks or automate complex procedures with a single command. Writing scripts also makes it possible to share what you can do with others and, as such, are one the simplest forms of computer program that you can write and distribute. Come learn how the magic of digital inscription can help you do your work, and increase your power to accomplish your dreams.
