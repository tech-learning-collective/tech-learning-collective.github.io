Get a crash course in cybersecurity fundamentals with the Tech Learning Collective in a preview of the forthcoming Security 101 course!

We'll be watching the first episode of Mr. Robot together in the new Wonderville space, and then immediately afterwards have a guided, in-depth look at the tools and concepts featured in it. This event will offer a brief inside look at some of what will be offered even more intensively in [our Security 101]({% link _courses/sec101.md %}) course.

No previous experience with the show or cybersecurity is required for this event. We are materially and culturally very welcoming for total newbies and experienced hackers alike.

You do not need to bring a laptop but may do so.

$10 suggested donation â€” help support our incredible hosts!
