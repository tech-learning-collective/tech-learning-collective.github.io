teaser: Learn the basics of website security auditing in this hands-on workshop that will introduce you to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), a free, open source Web application security scanner and intercepting proxy. We&rsquo;ll get set up with a practice target against which you can launch live-fire (but legal and safe!) Web exploits that run the gamut of attack categories from injection to broken authentication and access control. In the process, you&rsquo;ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about exploiting real vulnerabilities that are prevalent all across the Web today.

## Workshop Description

> According to [Douglas Crockford](https://crockford.com/), former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, &ldquo;The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.&rdquo; Given that it&rsquo;s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it&rsquo;s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to break *into* (or, *break out of*) that system.
>
> The &ldquo;front door&rdquo; to most targets is usually their Web site and so in this offensive security workshop you&rsquo;ll learn exactly how attackers, internal Red Teams, and professional penetration testers go about targeting websites, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting them. By using the [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org/), a free and open source Web application security scanner, you&rsquo;ll get a hands-on introduction to Web application security basics, intercepting proxy configuration, target scoping, and more. We&rsquo;ll be targeting the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/), an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities for us to learn about collectively known as the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.
>
> Today&rsquo;s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use&mdash;or even build!&mdash;can be made to fail in just the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. Come learn how to hack yourself before your opponents do, so you can find vulnerabilities and shore up defenses in your own Web projects before attackers get the chance to leak your sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, install malware on your systems, or penetrate your network.
