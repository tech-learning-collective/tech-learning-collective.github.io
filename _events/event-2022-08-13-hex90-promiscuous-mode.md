teaser: Hex90 is a &ldquo;queer hacker salon&rdquo; featuring music, dancing, visuals, and special performances. The most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name. After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network with your laptop, you can launch the Hex90 game in your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. Think every 90's hacker movie party scene but gayer, and kinder! You don't need to be a hacker to enjoy the party, and TLC instructors will be at the party ready to guide you if you want to learn some basic hacking techniques!

Queer hackers of the world, unite! Tech Learning Collective is excited to invite you to [Hex90&rsquo;s latest queer hacker salon, &ldquo;Promiscuous Mode,&rdquo;](https://hex90.party/) hosted at [Wonderville, where you can buy tickets](https://wonderville.nyc/).

HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC

It is time for us to reach the sky! By sunlight and moonlight, take flight! Let us imagine ourselves as stardust returning to our celestial origins, intertwingled together. We will burn the stars with our radiance!

Hackers are elemental. Like water, we are shapeless, yet we are every shape. We transition between states as our environment changes, changing the environment in the process. We can be as hard as ice, or as soft as flame. Opaque, or invisible, or spanning everything in between, we are the cloud. Ours is flesh that forms as quickly as it may float away. Impenetrable, or permeable. Our bodies, our choices, from one fluid moment to the next.

Information packets traverse the ether. Netflows quickly vanish over the horizon. There are traces of fire on the wire connecting our vibrating crystalline bodies. Sniff the wire to prime your electronic memory with the sounds of conversations past and present. Enter promiscuous mode, spread your wings, and fly to the stars with us!

DANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!

In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer," the game is not available on the public Internet.)

After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.

We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.

All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.

## About [Shift-CTRL Space](https://shiftctrl.space/)

We are anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against &ldquo;Adtech,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fintech,&rdquo; and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It is power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one&rsquo;s actual communities. Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being participatory, flexible, and adaptive.

## About [LiveCode.NYC](https://livecode.nyc/)

We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.

## About [Char Stiles](https://www.instagram.com/charstiles)

Char describes how photons work to sand that thinks, that is to say she livecodes GLSL visuals on the computer, that is to say she writes constantly compiling graphics algorithms on the GPU as a performance. This is in hopes it is entertainment.

## About [Voyde](https://instagram.com/voydescreamsback)

Indira/Voyde uses Unreal Engine in creating surreal landscapes made of liquid bodies, journalistic images, and narrative snapshots hidden deep inside, scrambled with voronoi.

Dan Gorelick is an SF and Brooklyn-based musician, creative technologist, and livecoder. He mixes acoustic instruments and voice with synthesizers (and code) to create expressive electronic music.
