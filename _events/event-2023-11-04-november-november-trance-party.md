Noble neighors!

Note this night of November the 4<sup>th</sup>, a noctural celebration notwithstanding November's numbing nonchalance, surely introduced by its nippy temperatures. Nay, our evening's novel narrative is nonfiction, and hosted by the neighborhood's most notorious gender nonconforming hacker nymph on skates, Vi, with her network of naturally talented nightingale performers!

Indeed, you navigated the seasons! Now, this 4<sup>th</sup> of November, nourish a nonstandard way to fall into Fall!

On the eve of November 5<sup>th</sup>, we'll prepare for the coming cold of Winter in the way we know best: enjoying cathartic, dreamy trance beats spun by some of Brooklyn's hottest DJs, basking in radio waves from WiFi-enabled digital libraries letting you browse thousands of e-books for free, and drinks with huggable friends, all bathed in the warm glow of Wonderville's many arcade cabinets. Drift into an exemplary, shimmering plane of possibilities to recharge your bio-batteries!

November the 4th is also DJ Astral_Dejection's birthday, so come early (before the show starts) to participate in a delicious name day treat this November, November that will never be forgot!

## About [Shift-CTRL Space](https://shiftctrl.space/)

Shift-CTRL Space is an elusive collective of New York City-based hacktivists whose mission is to strengthen local affinity groups with the power of contemporary digital technologies often hoarded by or made illegible by large corporations. As anti-(techno)capitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us against “Adtech,” “Fintech,” and Silicon Valley. We believe technology is an intangible earth, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It *is* power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for the empowerment of oneself and of one’s actual communities.

## About Vi "like the text editor"

If you've spent time in Bushwick's post-quarantine queer party scene or in a number of billiards bars around the city, you may have seen Vi zipping around on her rollerblades. As Brooklyn's own trans hacker roller slut, she has the type of main character energy found in cyberpunk hentai and is best known for her approachable, sporty whirlwind of kind, extroverted energy radiating from a hard femme candy shell. Whether she's holding a pool cue, a keyboard, a tequila shot, or all three, it's all about having a good, safe, and memorable time making people feel comfortable at the party. Say hi!
