Join the Tech Learning Collective at the [New York City Anarchist Bookfair](https://anarchistbookfair.net/) as we partner with the [Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki) to present *{{ page.title }}*. This workshop is a variation on [our &ldquo;Gone Phishing&rdquo; workshop]({% link _workshops/Gone Phishing: How to Recognize Fake Websites and Other Online Scams.md %}) geared especially for activists and others who are targeted by well-resourced adversaries such as law enforcement organizations (LEOs), national intelligence agencies, and private security contractors.

We will be in the Judson Memorial Church&rsquo;s Garden room at {{ page.startDate | date: site.time_format }} to help you learn how to defend against phishing, the most common type of cyberattack on the Internet today.

> Even if your online accounts are bulletproof, you can still get caught out by a &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; attack that steals your private data, like your username and password. In fact, from corporate espionage to police entrapment, most cyberattacks don&rsquo;t start with sophisticated software exploits, but rather by employing relatively simple tricks. These tricks are called &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; attacks because, much like baiting a lure, they won&rsquo;t work unless you bite. However, many people do get caught up by them.
>
> In 2019, ninety percent (90%!) of reported data breaches began with a simple phishing scam. Today, one and a half million new phishing websites are launched every month. Some are dragnets, while others are &ldquo;watering hole&rdquo; or even &ldquo;spear phishing&rdquo; attacks designed to target a specific demographic or even one individual high-value target (HVT). Thankfully, it's easy to spot&mdash;and even to perform&mdash;these tricks if you have the right guidance.
>
> In this hands-on digital workshop presented in collaboration with the radical queer and femme Tech Learning Collective, you will have the opportunity to create and deploy your own phishing Web site that can steal usernames and passwords from unsuspecting victims. By learning how attackers including law enforcement officers (LEOs) build pixel-perfect replicas of familiar sites like the Facebook login screen, you will also gain the skills you need to more quickly recognize the signs of a malicious web site, email, or other online scam.

Class space is limited! Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes early to reserve your seat.

You do not need to bring a laptop to class, but may want to do so to follow along with the exercises.

As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior *will* result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to [our lightweight social rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules) for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.
