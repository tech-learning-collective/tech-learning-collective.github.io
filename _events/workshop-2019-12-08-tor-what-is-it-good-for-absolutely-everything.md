{{ page.location }} in collaboration with The Tech Learning Collective presents *{{ page.title }}.* Come learn how the free Tor Web Browser can be your gateway to the Dark Web while simultaneously keeping you safer and your personal info more private as you browse web sites big and small.

> From illegal online drug stores like Silk Road to DDoS botnet command and control headquarters, media attention has long painted &ldquo;the Dark Web&rdquo; as though nothing good can come of it. But learn just a little bit more about how Tor and &ldquo;hidden services&rdquo; work and you&rsquo;ll find a treasure trove of valuable possibilities for day-to-day Internet use. The same technology that can hide the location of a drug ring can also serve as a free VPN-like service to protect your privacy while you browse the Internet, make censored websites available again, and even let you host your own Internet services for free, all without opening a single port on your firewall!

> In this deep dive workshop on [Tor](https://torproject.org/), the [Tech Learning Collective]({% link index.html %})&rsquo;s cybersecurity trainers will show you how to make the most of this widely available and free digital safety tool. They&rsquo;ll demonstrate numerous Tor features such as Tor authentication, target service load balancing, and NAT-punching. In the process, you&rsquo;ll finally understand—on a technical level—what the &ldquo;Dark Web&rdquo; actually is and how it works. Bring a laptop to class, and you&rsquo;ll leave having run your own Dark Web site. Whether you’re a veteran black hat or a timid newbie, this class will shine a light on the Dark Web once and for all.

Tickets are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Promo code <code>REDUCED</code> gets queer-identified and femme people $10 off their ticket.
