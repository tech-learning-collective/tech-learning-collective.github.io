teaser: Come exploring with us as we show you how to map out interconnections between computers, trace packet routes across network gateways, and find information about network operators. In this workshop all about the voyages of frames, packets, and segments, we use tools like `nmap` to send probes into cyberspace and tap into the wire with Wireshark to understand how they function.

## Workshop Description

> Have you ever wondered what&rsquo;s between your computer and the websites you visit? Are you curious about where your messages actually go in order to get from here to there? Do you wonder what a map of computer networks really looks like? Come exploring with us as we embark on a journey into cyberspace, the final Final Frontier! In this beginner-friendly workshop, we&rsquo;ll throw a metaphorical message in a bottle into the expanse of cyberspace, and learn how to sense and track its movement as it makes its way back to us&mdash;or not!
> 
These are the voyages of frames, packets, and segments&mdash;our messages&mdash;as they make their way across the vast reaches of the Internet. On the way, they&rsquo;ll encounter both friendly and unfriendly devices, such as routers, firewalls, traffic inspectors, or NAT tables. At each step of their journey, a complex series of decisions are made to determine where they&rsquo;ll be routed to next, or if their journey is at an end. By using network mapping tools such as [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) along with digital wiretapping tools like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) we can sense what happens on the far side of a network connection in much the same way as looking at the ripples on the surface of a river can tell us something about the shape of the riverbed.
>
> Join us to explore strange new networks, to seek out new devices and new organizations, to boldly go where only packets have gone before!
