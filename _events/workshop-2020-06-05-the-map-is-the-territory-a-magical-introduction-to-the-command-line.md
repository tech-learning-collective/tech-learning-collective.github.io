teaser: Get an introduction to interacting with your computer through the terminal, and a hint towards all the beautiful radical power possible there. We will learn some basics by doing spellwork, and by the end you will have literally gathered magical fragments from the ether and cast a spell from a modest digital altar.

## Workshop Description

> Beneath the visual surface of your computer is an old and powerful magic, a silent but quick stream of energy that the computer draws from for power. This magic is hidden but always present, like the sacred well held in the base of a cathedral.
> 
> This hidden place has many names: Shell, Terminal, Bash, Zsh, The Command Line.
>
> The command line is pure language, and to exist in it is to practice all the reality-shifting and world manifesting power of metaphor and dialogue. This is a place of empowerment, tangible creativity, and mystic bewilderment. While it can be dangerous, itâ€™s also exceedingly helfpul if you know how to listen.
>
> This place is waiting for you, but will not make itself known until you ask for it. You must take the first step.
