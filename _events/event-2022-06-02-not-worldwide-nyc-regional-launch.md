teaser: Have you wasted years of your life in service of a capitalist machine? There is a new machine taking shape, ready to build a new world. New Order Technoism invites you to find purpose, to submit yourself to something greater, to consider your second entropy, to compromise for a better VOID!

[New Order Technoism](https://notworldwide.org/) and friends of Tech Learning Collective invite you to [Liminal Space](https://www.liminalspace.nyc/) to experience the birth of a new machine, one made in and for a new world. Among other incredible performers, this event features DJ Niyah West, a semi-regular fixture at our own Hex90 queer hacker parties, along with livecoded visuals by Char Stiles, also a Hex90 favorite, who will be joined by Livecode.NYC star Indira! More tunes by BABES the DJ, a drag performance by God Complex, and you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it installations by Ru Electra round out the lineup for this one of a kind enigmatic experience.

Come for the shows, [buy a candle and pray with us](https://www.notworldwide.org/how-is-it), or read the DOOM scrolls while basking in the healing light of retro tech diagnostic testing offered by Anya Volz that may repair&mdash;or worsen&mdash;all your corruptions.

## About [LiveCode.NYC](https://livecode.nyc/)

We are primarily a meetup group who gets together to discuss programming in real time. We view live coding as a methodology and not medium specific. Some of our members code graphics, games, VR and a handful live code music. Many languages are used within the group, without one being prioritised. Many of us are artists. Sometimes we run events. The core of what we do is share live coding, whether discussing types at our meetups or teaching a system one of us built. We hope to continue to find ways in which we can do this, as a collective.

## About [Char Stiles](http://charstiles.com/)

Char Stiles is an artist, educator and programmer based in Brooklyn, NY. She works creatively in the lower levels of computational systems to bring to light how computers work. Char works and collaborates across mediums such as interactive installation, video, performance and web. She is a part of the Livecode.nyc collective, where she organizes shows, and livecodes music and visuals.
