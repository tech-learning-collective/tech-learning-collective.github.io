teaser: Learn the basics of Web publishing in a way that builds on your existing computer experience from the ground up! This workshop presents the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) the same way you might learn a new written language. By understanding the language&rsquo;s grammar and vocabulary, you can compose surprisingly complex and powerful Web pages without needing to know a programming language like JavaScript. If you&rsquo;ve used a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you have all the prerequisites you need to understand, at a deep and foundational level, what HTML is and how it works.

## Workshop Description

> The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the *language* that it actually is? What is HTML's grammar, where do HTML "sentences" begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don't need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.
>
> This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90's or just last week. Based on a portion of the [Tech Learning Collective's WEB101 course]({% link _courses/web101.md %}), it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web's most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like [Microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29) and [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa), learn how to write in the Web's native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly *understand* what you're saying.
