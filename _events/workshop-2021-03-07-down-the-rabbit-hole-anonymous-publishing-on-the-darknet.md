teaser: Get your message out without revealing who you are by publishing anonymously on the "Darknet." This workshop shows you how to create Tor Onion services for Web sites through free tools like OnionShare, and even by setting up Tor servers that are built and configured from scratch manually. You'll learn about how Tor helps keep both publishers and consumers private and anonymous online, as well as how law enforcement might successfully de-anonymize poorly configured Onion services through host bypass, fingerprint correlation, and other similar attacks.

## Workshop Description

> It's often said that if you want to tell people the truth, you'd better make them laugh&mdash;or they'll kill you. Sometimes, humor isn't a sufficient defense. For these situations, the only remaining defense is to become anonymous. In this deep-dive workshop on anonymous Internet publishing, you'll learn about a special class of proxy server called a Tor Onion service that makes it possible to publish Web sites or offer network-capable services more or, if you're really skilled, completely anonymously.
>
> Publishing something truly anonymously on the Internet today is getting more and more difficult. And yet, with "real name" requirements pushed by social media giants like Facebook, law enforcement agents demanding travelers' online usernames and passwords at border crossings, and global political campaigns to undermine or outright backdoor privacy-preserving encryption technologies, anonymous publishing is also getting more and more important. Whistleblowers need to be able to leak or publish anonymously to stay safe from legal and especially extralegal reprisals, and so too do politically vocal bloggers, investigative journalists, and citizens.
>
> In this specialized workshop, you'll see how Darknet Web sites like the now-famous Silk Road, as well as less controversial Web sites like the New York Times, actually use the same underlying technology called Tor Onion services to create their respective censorship-resistant publications. You'll also be exposed to some of the techniques that law enforcement often tries to use to de-anonymize Onion services, and learn how to defend against them. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a working knowledge of numerous critical modern technologies including Web servers, network relays, and Tor's famous onion-routing protocol.
