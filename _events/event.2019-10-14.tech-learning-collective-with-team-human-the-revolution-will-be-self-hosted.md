Each month, the crew at Team Human NYC hosts a guest to lead a conversation of shared interest that reflects the Team Human values. This month, they&rsquo;ve invited the Tech Learning Collective to learn about [our unique technology education pedagogy]({% post_url 2019-07-22-want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code %}).

From the Team Human NYC description:

> This month we'll speak with two instructors from the Tech Learning Collective. The Tech Learning Collective is an educational initiative run by radical queer and femme technologists offering unparalleled, free, by-donation, and low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.
>
> While politicians and federal bureaucracy lead reactive policy against big-tech, The Tech Learning Collective asks a more fundamental question: how can we engage with computer technology outside the realms of capitalism? Should digital literacy step beyond how to &ldquo;use&rdquo; or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; technology, and into how to &ldquo;own&rdquo; and &ldquo;share?&rdquo;
>
> We&rsquo;ll use this time together to explore The Tech Learning Collective and put our minds together to find how each of us can contribute towards this purpose.
>
> Learn more about The Tech Learning Collective here: [https://techlearningcollective.com/about/](https://techlearningcollective.com/about/)
>
> We'll start the event meeting and catching-up. Our guest will share some of their work and then have a discussion on the topic/issue they're presenting.
>
> Our goals for these events are to hear and share new ideas, challenge ourselves and others, and be able to leave the event with opportunities for ground-level action.

There is no charge for admittance to this event, but event space is limited. Please [RSVP via the Team Human NYC meetup event listing](https://www.meetup.com/Team-Human-NYC/events/265331433/) to reserve your seat.
