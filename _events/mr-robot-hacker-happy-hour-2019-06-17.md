Starr Bar in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: *Mr. Robot&rsquo;s Hacker Happy Hour*.

Get a crash course in cybersecurity fundamentals with the Tech Learning Collective!

We&rsquo;ll begin watching the first episode of [Mr. Robot](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/62560-mr-robot) together promptly at 7PM, and then immediately afterwards the Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s cybersecurity instructors will facilitate a guided, in-depth look at some of the [tools and concepts featured in the episode](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Mr.-Robot%27s-Netflix-%27n%27-Hack). This event offers a brief inside look at some of what is offered more intensively in [the Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s SEC101 course]({% link _courses/sec101.md %}).

No previous experience with the show or cybersecurity is required for this event. We are materially and culturally very welcoming for total newbies and experienced hackers alike. (You do not need to bring a laptop, but may do so.) Please be aware that Mr. Robot contains potentially triggering content.

We ask for a $10 suggested donation&mdash;help support our incredible hosts!

As with all Tech Learning Collective and Starr Bar events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior *will* result in immediate removal from the space without a refund. Please refer to [our lightweight social rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules) for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.
