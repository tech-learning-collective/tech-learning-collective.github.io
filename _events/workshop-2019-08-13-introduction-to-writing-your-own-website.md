PowrPlnt in collaboration with the Tech Learning Collective presents: *Introduction to Writing Your Own Website in HTML and CSS*. This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective's intensive [WEB101 course]({% link _courses/web101.md %}), is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced "front-end designers" will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites really are and how they&rsquo;re made:

> The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in terms of the *language* that it actually is? What is HTML's grammar, where do HTML "sentences" begin and end, and how is meaning represented in its elements? You don't need a computer science degree to learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.
>
> This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML once or twice, whether it was in the 90's or just last week. Based on a portion of the [Tech Learning Collective's WEB101 course]({% link _courses/web101.md %}), it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web's most powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like [Microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29) and [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa), learn how to write in the Web's native language so that both humans (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, use, and most importantly *understand* what you're saying.

Tickets are offered on a first-come, first-served basis:

* $25 - Suggested Donation (no one will be turned away for lack of funds!)

Class space is limited! Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes early to reserve your seat.

You do not need to bring a laptop to class, but may want to do so to follow along with the exercises.

As with all Tech Learning Collective events, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, “brogrammer,” “manarchist,” or any kind of similarly awful behavior *will* result in immediate removal from class without a refund. Please refer to [our lightweight social rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules) for details on our strictly enforced no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind.
