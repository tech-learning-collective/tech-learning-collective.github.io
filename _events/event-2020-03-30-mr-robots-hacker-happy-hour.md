In light of [recent events]({% post_url 2020-03-15-one-way-we-re-doing-what-we-can-to-support-our-community-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic %}), Tech Learning Collective wants to do our part to help fight social isolation while encouraging people to keep participating in &ldquo;social distancing,&rdquo; so we&rsquo;re inviting you to get a *FREE* crash course in cybersecurity fundamentals at this social virtual happy hour featuring clips from the first episode of TV&rsquo;s critically-acclaimed show, [<cite>Mr. Robot</cite>](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/62560-mr-robot)!

<big>[CLICK HERE TO JOIN THE EVENT](https://gobrunch.com/events/46638)</big>

You&rsquo;ll get the most out of the event if you watch Season 1, Episode 1 of Mr. Robot on your own. That way we can't spoil anything! We&rsquo;ll begin with a brief look at some of the tools and concepts featured in the episode, and then have a free-for-all Q&amp;A session where you&rsquo;ll get the opportunity to go in-depth with Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s cybersecurity trainers. Stick around for as long as you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself&mdash;you may even catch a live demo or two!

This event offers a brief inside look at some of the topics covered by Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s more in-depth security-related [workshops]({% link workshops/index.md %}) and our [SEC101 course]({% link _courses/sec101.md %}).

No previous experience with the show or cybersecurity is required for this event. We are materially and culturally very welcoming for total newbies and experienced hackers alike. Please be aware that Mr. Robot contains potentially triggering content.

<big>We are asking for a $10 suggested [donation]({% link donate/index.md %}) if you can afford it. Help support our incredible team of experts and expert teachers! No one will be turned away for lack of funds.</big>
