You&rsquo;ll get the most out of the event if you watch the featured episode of <cite>Mr. Robot</cite> on your own. That way we can't spoil anything! We&rsquo;ll begin with a brief look at some of the tools and concepts featured in the episode, and then have a free-for-all Q&amp;A session where you&rsquo;ll get the opportunity to go in-depth with Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s cybersecurity trainers. Stick around for as long as you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself&mdash;you may even catch a live demo or two!

This event offers a brief inside look at some of the topics covered by Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s more in-depth security-related [workshops]({% link workshops/index.md %}) and our [SEC101 course]({% link _courses/sec101.md %}).

No previous experience with the show or cybersecurity is required for this event. We are materially and culturally very welcoming for total newbies and experienced hackers alike. Please be aware that <cite>Mr. Robot</cite> contains potentially triggering content.
