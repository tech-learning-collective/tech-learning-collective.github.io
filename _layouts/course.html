These are stand-alone <a href="{% link events/calendar/index.md %}">free, by-donation, or low-cost events</a> that are either derived from or augment this course&rsquo;s material. Since they are taught by the same instructor(s) as this course, these workshops provide a low-commitment way to get a feel for the fuller course itself as well as offer a chance for you to meet some of our teaching team.</p>
