## What is a Capture the Flag game?

Capture the Flag competitions (CTFs) are sets of puzzles intended to distill the essence of many aspects of professional computer security work into a single short-lived exercise that is objectively measurable. Most competitions are free to participate in, and some even award prizes to winners. Individuals and teams compete against each other in a cybersecurity game that is full of puzzles to solve in different categories, like NetSec, AppSec, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, Web Exploitation, and more. The puzzles in each level get increasingly difficult as you solve them, which makes games great for beginners and experienced players alike.

You can either compete against yourself or against the other participants in the room. You can work individually or as a team. It's up to you!
