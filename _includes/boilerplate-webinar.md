As this is a remote/online-only event, there is no physical class space, but attendance is still limited to {{ page.maximumAttendeeCapacity }} students, so [purchase your ticket now](#tickets-{{ page.slug }}) to reserve your spot.

To participate in our webinars, you will need access to a modern Web browser such as an up-to-date copy of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). You will also need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend disabling Wi-Fi and plugging your computer in to a hard-wired Ethernet network cable for the duration of the webinar, if possible.

If you would like to share your video screen or appear on camera, you will need to have and activate your own camera, such as the one built-in to many modern laptops. Similarly, to speak with the rest of the webinar participants, you will need a microphone. If you do choose to activate your microphone, we ask that you please plug in headphones/ear buds or use a headset in order to help reduce audio feedback loops that can degrade the webinar experience for other participants.

Please refer to [our workshops and webinars FAQ]({% link faq/index.md %}#workshops-and-webinars) for additional tips and advice before you join the video conference.
