## About the Tech Learning Collective

Tech Learning Collective is an apprenticeship-based technology school aiming to train politically self-motivated individuals in the art of hypermedia, Information Technology, and radical political praxis. Run by radical queer and femme technologists, we offer unparalleled, low-cost computer classes primarily to marginalized groups and individuals who are politically engaged. Unlike coding bootcamps that focus on moving the highest number of students through rote task-completion for the goal of job placement, Tech Learning Collective teachers facilitate foundational skill building through Socratic discussion and kinetic, experience-based training.
