[DEFCON 201](https://www.defcon201.org/) (aka DC201) is the North NJ DEFCON local meetup group.

We are a place for local hackers, security professionals, makers, phreaks, locksmiths, technologist, nerds, geeks, technology activists, cypherpunks, sympathizers, and more unlabelable folks to meet up, share ideas and work on projects in the Garden State.
